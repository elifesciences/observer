          "text": "Over the last decade, the synapses that connect neurons have emerged as important therapeutic targets in a host of neurological disorders ranging from autism to Alzheimer’s disease. Synaptic signaling can either excite or inhibit the postsynaptic neuron, and the vast majority of excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain rely on structures called dendritic spines (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The 'head' of each dendritic spine contains receptors for the chemical neurotransmitter glutamate, which is released by the presynaptic neuron. Neurons can contain different types of glutamate receptors, but the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) is responsible for the majority of fast synaptic transmission and also controls the strength of the synapse.",

All-trans retinoic acid also increases the size of the spine apparatus, a synaptic organelle found in dendritic spines and previously linked to synapse remodeling (orange). To test whether the spine apparatus is important for the effects of all-trans retinoic acid on synapses, Lenz et al. compared wild-type (Synpo +, top), and synaptopodin-deficient (Synpo -, bottom) mice, which lack the spine apparatus. Synapses lacking the spine apparatus were smaller and failed to increase in strength after applying all-trans retinoic acid. However, applying the molecule still enlarged the spines without a spine apparatus, demonstrating that this organelle has a specific role in regulating changes in synaptic strength induced by all-trans retinoic acid.",

These changes are often accompanied by an increase or decrease in the size of the dendritic spine head (<a href=\"#bib7\">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</a>). Changes in synapse number or strength are a pathological hallmark of several diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and Alzheimer’s disease (<a href=\"#bib3\">Forrest et al., 2018</a>), which means that molecules that can consistently modify synapses are attractive as potential therapeutics. Among the most promising of these is a derivative of vitamin A called all-trans retinoic acid, which can potently increase synaptic strength in cultured rodent neurons (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aoto et al., 2008</a>). This molecule appears to function as part of a homeostatic pathway that engages the protein translation machinery in dendritic spines to increase the strength of synapses when synaptic input drops (<a href=\"#bib4\">Jakawich et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Wang et al., 2011</a>).",

But the critical question is whether these effects and mechanisms are readily translatable to the human brain. Now, in eLife, Andreas Vlachos of the University of Freiburg and colleagues – including Maximilian Lenz as first author – report striking parallels between human and rodent neurons in the synaptic effects of all-trans retinoic acid (<a href=\"#bib6\">Lenz et al., 2021</a>).",

They found that the molecule enhanced synaptic currents, without altering many other features of neuronal excitability. Along with these changes, Lenz et al. found that all-trans retinoic acid drove enlargement of dendritic spine heads, but the overall density of dendritic spines did not change: this suggests that all-trans retinoic acid drives AMPAR accumulation and structural plasticity at pre-existing synaptic sites. Finally, Lenz et al. demonstrated that the changes in synaptic strength induced by all-trans retinoic acid in human neurons depended on mRNA translation but not on transcription, a mechanistic signature first seen in rodent neurons.",

They found that all-trans retinoic acid enlarged the spine apparatus and, strikingly, that the cross-sectional area of the spine apparatus varied with the size of the dendritic spine itself. This suggests that the spine apparatus might have a key role in the modulation of synaptic strength by all-trans retinoic acid.",

They found that all-trans retinoic acid did not enhance synaptic currents in cortical pyramidal neurons in the knockout mice; however, when synaptopodin was reintroduced, all-trans retinoic acid was able to increase synaptic currents. Curiously, losing the spine apparatus did not prevent all-trans retinoic acid from enlarging dendritic spines, even though spine size was reduced in the synaptopodin knockout mice.",

These results underscore the fact that while morphological and functional changes are highly coordinated at cortical synapses, they likely rely on distinct mechanistic pathways.",
