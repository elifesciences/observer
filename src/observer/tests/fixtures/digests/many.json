This is why accidents and illnesses affecting the brain and spinal cord can cause permanent damage. Reactivating regeneration in neurons could help them repair, but it is not easy. Certain small molecules can switch repair signaling programs back on. Unfortunately, these molecules diffuse easily through tissues, spreading around the body and making it hard to target individual damaged cells. This both hampers research into neuronal repair and makes treatments directed at healing damage to the nervous system more likely to have side-effects.

Measuring activity in the neurons of the optic tectum revealed that, like the eye, different areas specialize in different tasks. The back of the tectum was frequently activated by small dots and worked out which direction they were moving in during the first hunting steps. The front of the tectum responded best to large dots, often ignoring their direction, and helped the larvae to track their prey straight ahead.
