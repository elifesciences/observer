The open-source Hypothesis software has been extensively customised for use by eLife and other publishers with new moderation features, single sign-on authentication and user-interface customisation options now giving publishers more control over its implementation on their sites.","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"eLife is a non-profit organisation that aims to help scientists accelerate discovery by operating a platform for research collaboration that encourages and recognises the most responsible behaviours in science. An open-access journal for the most promising advances in life science and biomedical research, eLife is also a platform for experimentation and showcasing innovation in research communication. The partnership with Hypothesis was announced in 2016 as an important advancement toward this goal.","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"Hypothesis is a California, USA-based non-profit organisation that develops open-source software with the power to create a conversation layer over the entire web. The implementation of the annotation tool on eLife\u2019s website means users can now make notes on all content, from research articles and commentaries to magazine articles and blog posts. All they need to do is sign in using an ORCiD iD to add or reply to public or private annotations.","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"Giuliano Maciocci, eLife\u2019s Head of Product, says: \u201cWe worked closely with Hypothesis to expand its original platform into a more versatile annotation experience that can now be integrated seamlessly into publishers\u2019 websites. The platform\u2019s new feature set includes an extensively reworked user interface that simplifies the annotation and discussion experience for our users. We have also added improved moderation and authentication features, giving publishers more control over how annotations are deployed on their sites, and which should result in higher-quality discussions around published scholarly content. With these new features now being live, we\u2019re delighted to already be seeing new publishers adopt the platform as a result of this collaboration.\u201d","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"Recently, the scholarly publishing platform PubFactory and content solutions provider Ingenta integrated the revamped Hypothesis service into their websites.

Both eLife and Hypothesis share a common goal in developing open-source software to facilitate such communication, and we\u2019re pleased to deliver a service that can be adopted easily by publishers. We hope many more will take advantage of the opportunity to provide their users with this new and exciting way of engaging with published content online.\u201d","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"Hypothesis\u2019 work with eLife is supported by the eLife Innovation Initiative, a program introduced to provide dedicated, strategic guidance to the organisation\u2019s ongoing efforts to create new technology and services to enhance research communication and discovery.","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"##","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"To view examples of eLife research articles that have been annotated using the Hypothesis tool, see:","type":"paragraph"},{"type":"list","items":["\u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.00461\u0022\u003Ehttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.00461\u003C\/a\u003E","\u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.04889\u0022\u003Ehttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.04889\u003C\/a\u003E","\u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.27860\u0022\u003Ehttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.27860\u003C\/a\u003E"],"prefix":"bullet"},{"text":"Publishers wishing to implement the tool and take advantage of its latest features can do so by contacting Heather Staines, Hypothesis\u0027 Director of Partnerships, at \u003Ca href=\u0022mailto:heather@hypothes.is\u0022\u003Eheather@hypothes.is\u003C\/a\u003E.","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"For more information about the development of the newly customised tool, visit: \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/elifesciences.org\/labs\/3f85f8c2\/enabling-scientific-discussion-on-elife-with-hypothesis\u0022\u003Ehttps:\/\/elifesciences.org\/labs\/3f85f8c2\/enabling-scientific-discussion-on-elife-with-hypothesis\u003C\/a\u003E","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"And for more details about eLife\u2019s partnership with Hypothesis, see: \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/elifesciences.org\/for-the-press\/7e7220f6\/elife-partners-with-hypothes-is-to-advance-open-scholarly-annotation\u0022\u003Ehttps:\/\/elifesciences.org\/for-the-press\/7e7220f6\/elife-partners-with-hypothes-is-to-advance-open-scholarly-annotation\u003C\/a\u003E","type":"paragraph"}],"mediaContacts":[{"name":{"preferred":"Emily Packer","index":"Packer, Emily"},"emailAddresses":["e.packer@elifesciences.org"],"phoneNumbers":["+441223855373"],"affiliations":[{"name":["eLife"]}]}],"about":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"\u003Cb\u003EAbout eLife\u003C\/b\u003E"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"eLife is a non-profit organisation inspired by research funders and led by scientists.
