On one hand, social media makes science information more accessible to those who are curious about a certain topic, as well as to people who may be less likely to seek out scientific content. However, it can also create a Dunning-Kruger effect whereby some people – particularly those who have limited prior knowledge of the subject – leave a post or video believing they are more of an expert than they are. There’s also a lot of false information that is portrayed in a way that feels like legitimate science.",

While a good summary is fantastic for getting important points across quickly, it often leaves more room for misinterpretation or oversimplification, leading to clickbait headlines that do more harm than good. I generally hate to be anything but optimistic, but the way the pandemic and COP26 have panned out have highlighted the big gap that still exists between successful science communication and the general public.",
