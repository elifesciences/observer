More recently I launched another YouTube channel called \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCJJE7Kx6HDKikXhmu5m1hKg\u0022\u003EIn\u00e9s-table\u003C\/a\u003E, which is entirely in Spanish.","type":"paragraph"}]},{"type":"section","title":"\u003Cstrong\u003EHow does your content on In\u00e9s-table differ from Draw Curiosity?\u003C\/strong\u003E","content":[{"text":"I noticed when participating in Spanish scicomm events that attendees there are often younger than at English-speaking events, and have slightly different preferences and needs when turning to educational content on YouTube. For example, many Spanish-speaking viewers are looking for content that could serve as a supplementary study guide, as well as guidance in terms of what to study at university. So, the videos I post on In\u00e9s-table tend to provide a broader and more general overview of a subject, whereas Draw Curiosity tends to focus on highly-detailed topics.","type":"paragraph"}]},{"type":"section","title":"\u003Cstrong\u003EYou created and ran Draw Curiosity at the same time as conducting your PhD at Oxford.

This is likely because YouTube started promoting videos based on the aggregated amount of time people spent watching them rather than number of viewers. Also, I think people enjoy watching deep dives and analyses on specific topics more than shorter, more superficial videos \u2013 I know I do!","type":"paragraph"}]},{"type":"section","title":"\u003Cstrong\u003EWhich video are you the proudest of?\u003C\/strong\u003E","content":[{"text":"The videos in my playlist \u201c\u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLdNfe9CByWuasVkgyl561m2yfEGWHqtSH\u0022\u003ENew to the Channel?

On one hand, social media makes science information more accessible to those who are curious about a certain topic, as well as to people who may be less likely to seek out scientific content. However, it can also create a Dunning-Kruger effect whereby some people \u2013 particularly those who have limited prior knowledge of the subject \u2013 leave a post or video believing they are more of an expert than they are. There\u2019s also a lot of false information that is portrayed in a way that feels like legitimate science.","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"I think this problem is further exacerbated by the fact social media content is getting much shorter \u2013 like on TikTok, Instagram stories, Snapchat. While a good summary is fantastic for getting important points across quickly, it often leaves more room for misinterpretation or oversimplification, leading to clickbait headlines that do more harm than good. I generally hate to be anything but optimistic, but the way the pandemic and COP26 have panned out have highlighted the big gap that still exists between successful science communication and the general public.","type":"paragraph"}]},{"type":"section","title":"\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat advice would you give to budding YouTubers?\u003C\/strong\u003E","content":[{"text":"I would urge new science communicators to focus on delivery over video techniques at first \u2013 good storytelling trumps a flashy presentation every time.
