The synapse regulates T cell activation by maximizing the contact area and organizing the T cell receptors (TCR) and associated signaling proteins into zones. Strong antigenic stimuli create three concentric regions (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib48\">Monks et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib22\">Grakoui et al., 1999</xref>): a central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC), an intermediate zone (the peripheral SMAC, or pSMAC), and a zone at the synapse edge (the distal SMAC, or dSMAC) (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib20\">Freiberg et al., 2002</xref>). TCRs assemble with scaffolding and signaling proteins to form microclusters in the dSMAC which migrate centripetally towards the cSMAC (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib22\">Grakoui et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib36\">Krummel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib9\">Campi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib67\">Varma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib78\">Yokosuka et al., 2005</xref>). As they move, TCR microclusters activate a MAP kinase cascade and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) channels, both of which are essential to initiate gene expression programs that drive T cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib18\">Feske et al., 2001</xref>). Signaling by TCR microclusters is terminated as they enter the cSMAC by the dissociation of signaling proteins (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib78\">Yokosuka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib9\">Campi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib67\">Varma et al., 2006</xref>) and endocytosis of TCRs (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib38\">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib43\">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib12\">Das et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the strength of signaling at the synapse is thought to reflect a dynamic balance between formation of new microclusters in the dSMAC/pSMAC and their disassembly and internalization in the cSMAC."

In the dSMAC, actin is dense and highly branched (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib53\">Parsey and Lewis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib8\">Bunnell et al., 2001</xref>) and exhibits rapid retrograde flow similar to actin in the lamellipod of migrating cells. In the neighboring pSMAC region, actin is less dense and resembles a lamella with actin organized into concentric arcs by myosin IIA (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib2\">Babich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib79\">Yi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib84\">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Actin is sparse in the actin-depleted zone (ADZ) corresponding to the cSMAC. Centripetal actin flow regulates TCR function in at least two ways. First, it transports TCR microclusters towards the cSMAC where they are disassembled, limiting the signaling lifetime of each microcluster to a few minutes (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib82\">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib67\">Varma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib78\">Yokosuka et al., 2005</xref>). Second, actin polymerization and depolymerization are critical for microcluster formation and function, based on the ability of cytochalasin D (an actin polymerization inhibitor) and jasplakinolide (an actin depolymerization inhibitor) to rapidly quell microcluster formation, MAP kinase signaling, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at the synapse (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib66\">Valitutti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib67\">Varma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib58\">Rivas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib2\">Babich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib79\">Yi et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the mechanisms that control actin organization and flow at the synapse are key to understanding synapse formation as well as T-cell signaling."

Puncta containing STIM1 and Orai1 appeared at the contact zone beginning within seconds of initial contact and continuing through the spreading phase. After cells had spread fully (3\u20137\u2009min after contact with the coverslip), colocalized puncta of STIM1 and Orai1 continued to increase in number and intensity over the next several minutes and appeared to be confined to the center of the synapse (68 of 82 cells; <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media1\">Video 1</xref>). While the great majority of cells had centralized puncta, the abundance varied from only 5 to an array too densely packed to accurately count, possibly reflecting cell-to-cell variations in STIM1 and Orai1 expression and the degree of ER [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] depletion. In a minority of cells (27 of 68 cells), puncta containing STIM1 and Orai1 were detected near the periphery and moved toward the center of the synapse (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media1\">Video 1</xref>) with an average velocity of 47 \u00b1 3 nm/s (n\u00a0=\u00a024 puncta; mean \u00b1 SEM). These motile puncta were more frequently detected in 0.5\u20130.8\u2009mM extracellular\u00a0Ca<sup>2+</sup>\u00a0(Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub>;\u00a048% of 33 cells) than in 2\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub>(31% of 35 cells), probably because a greater degree of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion is expected under the reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> conditions. Thus, we suspect that our experiments actually underestimate the number of motile STIM1-Orai complexes at the synapse because they are dim and difficult to detect when ER [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is only partially depleted. Puncta of colocalized STIM1 and Orai1 correspond to ER-PM junctions where STIM1-bound Orai1 conducts Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cell (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib44\">Luik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib75\">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that as the synapse matures ER-PM junctions become concentrated in the center of the contact zone, and individual ER-PM junctions loaded with STIM1 and Orai1 translocate from the periphery to further increase the density of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx sites in the center.<media content-type=\"glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310\" href=\"elife-14850-media1.mp4\" id=\"media1\" mime-subtype=\"mp4\" mimetype=\"video\"><object-id pub-id-type=\"doi\">10.7554/eLife.14850.004</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>STIM1 and Orai1 accumulate in puncta in the center of the synapse.</title><p>Time-lapse TIRF movie of a Jurkat cell expressing mCh-STIM1 (left) and Orai1-EGFP (center) stimulated on an anti-CD3-coated coverslip.

In general, ER tubules can extend by sliding along the sides of microtubules or by attaching to the tips of growing microtubules (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib72\">Waterman-Storer and Salmon, 1998</xref>) through an interaction between STIM1 and the microtubule tip attachment proteins EB1 and EB3 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib23\">Grigoriev et al., 2008</xref>). In Jurkat cells expressing EB1 labeled with EGFP (EB1-EGFP) and ER-mCh, EB1 was seen at the tips of many extending ER tubules (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media4\">Video 4</xref>), confirming that ER tubules can extend toward the synapse periphery by attaching to the tips of growing microtubules.

In the majority of cells (38 of 45), the distinguishing features of the lamellipod and lamella were lost: ruffling at the periphery was greatly reduced and lamella actin arcs became less apparent, the lamella/lamellipod boundary disappeared as F-actin became more uniformly distributed across the synapse, and in some cells (15 of 45) F-actin extended into the ADZ (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media6\">Video 6</xref>). Most strikingly, the centripetal movement of actin was severely reduced and any remaining movement was less radial and more randomly oriented (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media6\">Video 6</xref>). These effects all reversed within seconds of restoring Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub>, and were also observed in cells expressing GFP-actin (data not shown).

                                "text": "A critical question is whether these effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on actin in Jurkat leukemic T cells extend to primary human T cells making synapses in a more physiological setting. A recent report has described WASp-associated actin foci in primary T cell synapses that were not detectable in Jurkat cells, suggesting that actin organization in primary T cells may be more complex than previously recognized (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib37\">Kumari et al., 2015</xref>). Jurkat cells also lack the lipid phosphatase PTEN, which may affect actin dynamics by enhancing PIP<sub>3</sub> accumulation in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib60\">Shan et al., 2000</xref>). Finally, primary T cells are normally activated by APCs displaying the integrin ICAM-1, which modestly alters actin organization and slows retrograde actin flow at the synapse (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib10\">Comrie et al., 2015</xref>). To investigate effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on actin dynamics in a more physiological model, we transduced primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphoblasts with Lifeact-GFP, a short F-actin binding peptide from Abp140 tethered to GFP (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib56\">Riedl et al., 2008</xref>). T lymphoblasts plated on anti-CD3- and ICAM-1-coated\u00a0coverslips formed a distinct lamellipod with rapid retrograde actin flow as described previously (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib10\">Comrie et al., 2015</xref>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal altered the distribution of synaptic actin and reduced ruffling and retrograde flow (20 of 21 cells; <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media7\">Video 7</xref>). Kymograph analysis showed that on average, Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal slowed actin flow by 44% and Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> reperfusion restored it to 97% of the initial velocity (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tbl1\">Table 1</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal narrowed the lamellipod by 61%, while Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> restoration returned the lamellipod to 82% of its initial width (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tbl1\">Table 1</xref>). T lymphoblasts on coverslips coated with anti-CD3 alone produced similar responses (<xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media8\">Video 8</xref>, 40 of 45 cells, <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tbl1\">Table 1</xref>). Thus, primary T lymphoblasts and Jurkat T cells responded similarly to changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub>, supporting the use of Jurkat T cells as a physiologically relevant model system for studying the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on actin dynamics at the synapse.<media content-type=\"glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310\" href=\"elife-14850-media7.mp4\" id=\"media7\" mime-subtype=\"mp4\" mimetype=\"video\"><object-id pub-id-type=\"doi\">10.7554/eLife.14850.013</object-id><label>Video 7.</label><caption><title>Calcium influx organizes synaptic actin and promotes retrograde flow in primary human T lymphoblasts plated on anti-CD3 and ICAM-1.</title><p>Time-lapse spinning disk confocal movie of a human T lymphoblast expressing Lifeact-GFP after spreading on anti-CD3 and ICAM-1 Fc in 0.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> (left), 1.3 min following perfusion with 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> (center) and 2.2 min after perfusion with 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> (right).

We first examined the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on synaptic actin depolymerization in cells coexpressing F-tractin-P-tdTom and photoactivatable GFP-labeled actin (PAGFP-actin). After brief photoactivation of a small region, the GFP fluorescence indicates only F-actin, because monomeric PAGFP-actin rapidly escapes the region by diffusion; thus, the subsequent decay of fluorescence provides a measure of the actin depolymerization rate (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib46\">McGrath et al., 1998</xref>). 3\u20137 min after settling onto stimulatory coverslips, images of F-tractin-P-tdTom were used to identify cells with steady-state treadmilling actin and small (~1 by 3 \u00b5m) regions in the lamella and lamellipod were defined for photoactivation (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6A</xref>, left, red ovals). PAGFP actin was first photoactivated in the presence Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> and again ~2\u2009min following Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal when F-actin had reached a new steady-state (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"other\" rid=\"media10\">Video 10</xref>). After each photoactivation, the resulting GFP fluorescence was measured over time by widefield microscopy rather than TIRF in order to prevent any change in signal due to possible movement of actin in the Z direction, and translocation of the photoactivated region was used to measure centripetal velocity.<media content-type=\"glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310\" href=\"elife-14850-media10.mp4\" id=\"media10\" mime-subtype=\"mp4\" mimetype=\"video\"><object-id pub-id-type=\"doi\">10.7554/eLife.14850.023</object-id><label>Video 10.</label><caption><title>Calcium increases actin depolymerization and centripetal velocity at the synapse.</title><p>Time-lapse TIRF movie of a Jurkat cell expressing F-tractin-P-tdTom and PAGFP-actin.

In contrast, fluorescence in the lamella increased only minimally during the 30\u2009s following photoactivation.

We were able to address the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the mature synapse by acutely blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx after the synapse was fully formed as indicated by its stable contact area, well-defined lamellipod and lamella actin zones, and retrograde actin flow. In both Jurkat cells and primary T lymphoblasts, Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal triggered similar changes in actin organization and retrograde flow. Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal slowed retrograde flow in the lamellipod to nearly the same degree in both cells (41% decrease in Jurkat versus 44% in primary T cells; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tbl1\">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tbl2\">2</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal diminished the lamellipod in primary T cells, reducing its width by 61%, while in Jurkat cells the effect was somewhat more pronounced with the lamellipod becoming indistinguishable from the rest of the actin network. Overall, these results demonstrate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects on actin organization and dynamics are not specific to Jurkat cells but apply also to primary T cells. Furthermore, T lymphoblasts responded similarly to Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal when stimulated on surfaces including ICAM-1 in order to more closely resemble an APC, indicating that our findings extend to more physiological surface interactions. New optical technologies such as light sheet microscopy may enable further studies of Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects on actin dynamics in the most physiological setting, at the synapse between a primary T cell and an APC\u00a0(<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib57\">Ritter et al., 2015</xref>)."

First, Ca<sup>2+</sup> directs actin polymerization largely to the distal edge of the lamellipod while suppressing it elsewhere (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig7\">Figure 7</xref>). By effectively restricting polymerization to the edge, Ca<sup>2+</sup> suppresses filament growth at random angles throughout the synapse and promotes retrograde vectorial movement of actin filaments (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig8\">Figure 8</xref>). Second, Ca<sup>2+</sup> accelerates actin depolymerization (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6</xref>), which is expected to enhance the rate of actin flow further by increasing the level of monomeric actin and therefore the rate of actin addition to free barbed ends at the lamellipod edge (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig8\">Figure 8</xref>). Overall, these findings demonstrate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> adds a second level of regulation to actin remodeling downstream of TCR triggering. The net effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is to suppress the density of F-actin at the synapse (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5</xref>), which was somewhat surprising given that elevating intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been reported to increase the level of F-actin in unstimulated T cells (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib15\">Dushek et al., 2008</xref>). This discrepancy may have resulted from the different imaging methods that were used; flow cytometry may indicate an increased level of F-actin globally (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib15\">Dushek et al., 2008</xref>), while TIRF or confocal imaging at the cell footprint may instead detect a local decrease in F-actin at the synapse (this study). Alternatively, TCR triggering may initiate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive actin regulatory pathways that are quiescent in resting cells, and thus Ca<sup>2+</sup> engages a different set of actin remodeling proteins after TCR stimulation."

The extensive polymerization at the lamellipod edge is closely paralleled by the recruitment of the WAVE2/Abi1 complex to the periphery (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig7\">Figure 7</xref>), where it presumably activates Arp2/3 to initiate actin polymerization and branching (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib62\">Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007</xref>). A central question arising from these findings is how Ca<sup>2+</sup> directs WAVE2/Abi1 to the periphery. One possible mechanism is suggested by the ability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to stimulate PI3K localization to the lamellipod of migrating cells, where generation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>) may recruit the WAVE2 complex to the membrane (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib52\">Oikawa et al., 2004</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> may exert additional effects through its ability to promote GTP loading of Rac, a GTPase essential for WAVE2-mediated actin nucleation (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib19\">Fleming et al., 1999</xref>). The mechanism by which Ca<sup>2+</sup> suppresses polymerization elsewhere in the lamella and lamellipod is also unknown, although Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive capping proteins expressed in T cells such as gelsolin (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib80\">Yin, 1987</xref>) or CapG (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib83\">Yu et al., 1990</xref>) are attractive candidates.

Our results provide the first view of ER dynamics at the synapse and how the actin cytoskeleton restricts both the ER and CRAC channel distribution to the cSMAC/ADZ. As the synapse forms, STIM1 and Orai1 appear in the cSMAC/ADZ by two mechanisms. The first is related to the movement of the centrosome and associated MTOC to the synapse, as EM tomography has shown enrichment of the ER around the centrosome at synaptic contact sites (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib65\">Ueda et al., 2011</xref>). This mechanism appears to account for the bulk of ER localization and STIM1-Orai1 complexes as cells settled onto coverslips. Once a stable synapse formed, microtubule extension carried ER tubules toward the periphery, and these were repeatedly returned to the ADZ by an advancing front of actin. A similar action of actin to oppose the extension of microtubules and associated ER tubules has also been described at the leading edge of migrating epithelial cells (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib63\">Terasaki and Reese, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib71\">Waterman-Storer and Salmon, 1997</xref>). Our observations that STIM1/Orai1 puncta and actin move towards the ADZ at similar speeds suggest that nascent ER tubules may form ER-PM junctions in peripheral regions, which then enable the assembly of active STIM1-Orai1 complexes that traverse the lamella before they are collected in the ADZ. Interestingly, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to membrane phospholipids is thought to enhance TCR signaling by exposing membrane-associated CD3 ITAM motifs (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib61\">Shi et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, an intriguing possibility is that mobile CRAC channel complexes create local sites of high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> needed to fully activate mobile TCR microclusters."

This loop creates the potential for nonlinear effects, such that graded increases or decreases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> may act through actin to modulate TCR activity and bias the cell towards all-or-none, threshold-like behavior in response to antigen. At the same time, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx effectively limits the lifetime of active TCR microclusters by increasing the rate at which they are transported to the synapse center, where signaling is terminated (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib82\">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib67\">Varma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib78\">Yokosuka et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, the accumulation of STIM1 and Orai1 in the ADZ reveals a new type of CRAC channel self-organization. At the level of single ER-PM junctions, STIM1 and Orai1 complexes self-organize through a diffusion trap mechanism based on STIM1 binding to the PM and Orai1 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib76\">Wu et al., 2014</xref>).

In kymographs, each pixel represents the average intensity across the 5-pixel width of the scan line. Spatiotemporal image correlation spectroscopy (STICS) analysis was used to determine the direction and velocity of actin movement by applying an ImageJ plugin (STICS map jru v2, developed by Jay Unruh at Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, MO) based on methods developed by Hebert et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib24\">Hebert et al., 2005</xref>).

To measure the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dependence of F-tractin-P fluorescence, F-tractin-P intensity was normalized to an average of the final five images collected in 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup>, at which time the fura-2 ratio had reached a minimum value of 0.39 \u00b1 0.04 (mean \u00b1 SEM, n\u00a0=\u00a026 cells). Data points represent the mean F-tractin-P fluorescence and fura-2 ratio when both signals were at steady-state and the sample size was selected to ensure that the cell population represented a broad range of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. PAGFP fluorescence decay was measured within an ROI encompassing the photoactivated region that was moved centripetally to remain centered on the fluorescent bar of actin. The time course was fitted by a single exponential function using IgorPro (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR). At each time point, the mean intensity across the width of the photoactivated bar was measured along a line perpendicular to the direction of movement, and displacement of the peak fluorescence value versus time was used to calculate velocity. To create fluorescence profile plots of PAGFP-actin incorporation, the fluorescence intensity as a function of radial position was calculated by averaging across 19 pixel-wide scan lines, subtracting the average of 10 scans acquired before photoactivation, and plotting the result relative to this pre-photoactivation signal."

The more specific question is how calcium entry through this channel alters actin and ER to drive specialization of the region (e.g., concentration of Orai Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, etc.) while recycling T cell receptors. The main conclusions are that actin reorganizes into a lamellipod with retrograde actin flow. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promotes actin depolymerization and localizes actin polymerization to the periphery of the lamellipod. Overall, the continuous actin reorganization drives microtubule bound ER and to the synapse center, presumably keeping the ER/PM junctions formed by Stim intact."

In the Kumari paper WAVE2 localization (which was punctate throughout the cell footprint) was shown only in a single cell imaged at a very early time point (2\u2019 after stimulation) when the cell was still in the spreading phase of synapse formation and the lamellipod had not yet formed (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B). In another study by Le Floc\u2019h et al. (Le Floc\u2019h et al. J. Exp. Med. 210:2721\u201337, 2013.), WAVE2 was also localized throughout the cell footprint at an early time, but became concentrated at the cell edge by 9 min, when the synapse had fully formed (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1B</xref> of that paper). At later times (18-45 min), WAVE2 became most concentrated in the lamella/pSMAC where LFA-1 accumulates. Our results are consistent with these studies, in that we are specifically visualizing WAVE2 at 6 min after plating, which is shortly after the cell has fully spread, and we verify this by selecting cells that have a clearly lamellipod by phalloidin staining. This phase of synapse formation is equivalent to the 9 min time point in Le Floc\u2019h et al."
