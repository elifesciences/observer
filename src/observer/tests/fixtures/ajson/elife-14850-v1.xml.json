At the synapse, actin reorganizes into a concentric lamellipod and lamella with retrograde actin flow that helps regulate the intensity and duration of TCR signaling. We find that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is required to drive actin organization and dynamics at the synapse. Calcium acts by promoting actin depolymerization and localizing actin polymerization and the actin nucleation promotion factor WAVE2 to the periphery of the lamellipod while suppressing polymerization elsewhere. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent retrograde actin flow corrals ER tubule extensions and STIM1/Orai1 complexes to the synapse center, creating a self-organizing process for CRAC channel localization. Our results demonstrate a new role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a critical regulator of actin organization and dynamics at the synapse, and reveal potential feedback loops through which Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx may modulate TCR signaling."

At the synapse, actin reorganizes into a concentric lamellipod and lamella with retrograde actin flow that helps regulate the intensity and duration of TCR signaling. We find that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is required to drive actin organization and dynamics at the synapse. Calcium acts by promoting actin depolymerization and localizing actin polymerization and the actin nucleation promotion factor WAVE2 to the periphery of the lamellipod while suppressing polymerization elsewhere. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent retrograde actin flow corrals ER tubule extensions and STIM1/Orai1 complexes to the synapse center, creating a self-organizing process for CRAC channel localization. Our results demonstrate a new role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a critical regulator of actin organization and dynamics at the synapse, and reveal potential feedback loops through which Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx may modulate TCR signaling."

Immune cells known as T cells recognize infection through a protein on their surface known as the T cell receptor. The T cell receptor binds to foreign proteins displayed on the surface of other cells. This interaction initiates a chain of events, including the opening of calcium channels embedded in the T cell membrane known as CRAC channels, which allows calcium ions to flow into the cell. These events ultimately lead to the activation of the T cell, enabling it to mount an immune response against the foreign invader."

It is not entirely clear how the binding of T cell receptors to foreign proteins drives the actin rearrangements, but there is indirect evidence suggesting that calcium ions may be involved."

When calcium ions were prevented from entering the T cell, the movement of actin stopped almost entirely. Thus, the flow of calcium ions into the T cell through CRAC channels is essential for driving the actin movements that underlie immune synapse development and T cell activation."

The synapse regulates T cell activation by maximizing the contact area and organizing the T cell receptors (TCR) and associated signaling proteins into zones. Strong antigenic stimuli create three concentric regions (<a href=\"#bib48\">Monks et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Grakoui et al., 1999</a>): a central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC), an intermediate zone (the peripheral SMAC, or pSMAC), and a zone at the synapse edge (the distal SMAC, or dSMAC) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Freiberg et al., 2002</a>). TCRs assemble with scaffolding and signaling proteins to form microclusters in the dSMAC which migrate centripetally towards the cSMAC (<a href=\"#bib22\">Grakoui et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Krummel et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Campi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Varma et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yokosuka et al., 2005</a>). As they move, TCR microclusters activate a MAP kinase cascade and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) channels, both of which are essential to initiate gene expression programs that drive T cell proliferation and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Feske et al., 2001</a>). Signaling by TCR microclusters is terminated as they enter the cSMAC by the dissociation of signaling proteins (<a href=\"#bib78\">Yokosuka et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Campi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Varma et al., 2006</a>) and endocytosis of TCRs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Das et al., 2004</a>). Thus, the strength of signaling at the synapse is thought to reflect a dynamic balance between formation of new microclusters in the dSMAC/pSMAC and their disassembly and internalization in the cSMAC."

In the dSMAC, actin is dense and highly branched (<a href=\"#bib53\">Parsey and Lewis, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bunnell et al., 2001</a>) and exhibits rapid retrograde flow similar to actin in the lamellipod of migrating cells. In the neighboring pSMAC region, actin is less dense and resembles a lamella with actin organized into concentric arcs by myosin IIA (<a href=\"#bib2\">Babich et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Yi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Yu et al., 2012</a>). Actin is sparse in the actin-depleted zone (ADZ) corresponding to the cSMAC. Centripetal actin flow regulates TCR function in at least two ways. First, it transports TCR microclusters towards the cSMAC where they are disassembled, limiting the signaling lifetime of each microcluster to a few minutes (<a href=\"#bib82\">Yu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Varma et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yokosuka et al., 2005</a>). Second, actin polymerization and depolymerization are critical for microcluster formation and function, based on the ability of cytochalasin D (an actin polymerization inhibitor) and jasplakinolide (an actin depolymerization inhibitor) to rapidly quell microcluster formation, MAP kinase signaling, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at the synapse (<a href=\"#bib66\">Valitutti et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Varma et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Rivas et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Babich et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Yi et al., 2012</a>).

Puncta containing STIM1 and Orai1 appeared at the contact zone beginning within seconds of initial contact and continuing through the spreading phase. After cells had spread fully (3\u20137\u2009min after contact with the coverslip), colocalized puncta of STIM1 and Orai1 continued to increase in number and intensity over the next several minutes and appeared to be confined to the center of the synapse (68 of 82 cells; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). While the great majority of cells had centralized puncta, the abundance varied from only 5 to an array too densely packed to accurately count, possibly reflecting cell-to-cell variations in STIM1 and Orai1 expression and the degree of ER [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] depletion. In a minority of cells (27 of 68 cells), puncta containing STIM1 and Orai1 were detected near the periphery and moved toward the center of the synapse (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) with an average velocity of 47 \u00b1 3 nm/s (n\u00a0=\u00a024 puncta; mean \u00b1 SEM). These motile puncta were more frequently detected in 0.5\u20130.8\u2009mM extracellular\u00a0Ca<sup>2+</sup>\u00a0(Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub>;\u00a048% of 33 cells) than in 2\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub>(31% of 35 cells), probably because a greater degree of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion is expected under the reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> conditions. Thus, we suspect that our experiments actually underestimate the number of motile STIM1-Orai complexes at the synapse because they are dim and difficult to detect when ER [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is only partially depleted. Puncta of colocalized STIM1 and Orai1 correspond to ER-PM junctions where STIM1-bound Orai1 conducts Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cell (<a href=\"#bib44\">Luik et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wu et al., 2006</a>). Thus, our results suggest that as the synapse matures ER-PM junctions become concentrated in the center of the contact zone, and individual ER-PM junctions loaded with STIM1 and Orai1 translocate from the periphery to further increase the density of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx sites in the center."

In agreement with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bunnell et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kaizuka et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Yu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Babich et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Yi et al., 2012</a>), cells formed a peripheral lamellipod characterized by a bright band of actin that appeared striated and ruffled in and out of the TIRF plane. At the inner edge of the lamellipod, actin density dropped off sharply, marking the transition into the lamella region where actin formed arc-like structures encircling a central ADZ (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Actin moved continually in a radial retrograde direction at velocities that declined from ~100 nm/s at the cell edge to near 0 nm/s at the border of the ADZ (data not shown). The highest density of STIM1 puncta occurred within the ADZ while dimmer, more dynamic STIM1-containing tubules extended into the lamella (21 of 21 cells; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Kymograph analysis shows that STIM1 puncta in the lamella move centripetally with and at the same velocity as F-actin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). These observations suggest that the advancing actin cytoskeletal network moves STIM1/Orai1 puncta and the associated ER-PM junctions towards the ADZ."

To better understand the mechanisms underlying CRAC channel positioning we examined ER localization and dynamics and their potential links to the actin cytoskeleton. We labeled actin and the ER membrane by expressing GFP-actin and mCherry tail-anchored to the ER membrane (ER-mCh) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bulbarelli et al., 2002</a>). The ER appeared in the TIRF evanescent field within minutes of cell contact with the stimulatory coverslips and expanded peripherally as cells spread (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). The ER near the PM was highly enriched in the ADZ (20 of 20 cells) in both tubular and sheet-like structures that became more centrally concentrated and immobile as the ring of actin surrounding the ADZ contracted. Dynamic ER tubules extended from the ADZ toward the lamellipod (16 of 20 cells; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, pink arrows) and occasionally traversed the lamella/lamellipod border, then either rapidly retracted along a similar trajectory (10 of 20 cells; Figure 2Bii, green arrows), or appeared to bend before moving centripetally (20 of 20 cells; Figure 2Biii, cyan arrows). A subset of tubules that penetrated the lamellipod remained relatively immobile in actin-sparse regions (8 of 20 cells; Figure 2Biii, yellow arrows)."

In general, ER tubules can extend by sliding along the sides of microtubules or by attaching to the tips of growing microtubules (<a href=\"#bib72\">Waterman-Storer and Salmon, 1998</a>) through an interaction between STIM1 and the microtubule tip attachment proteins EB1 and EB3 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Grigoriev et al., 2008</a>). In Jurkat cells expressing EB1 labeled with EGFP (EB1-EGFP) and ER-mCh, EB1 was seen at the tips of many extending ER tubules (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>), confirming that ER tubules can extend toward the synapse periphery by attaching to the tips of growing microtubules. ER tubules rarely extended into the lamellipod, likely reflecting infrequent microtubule forays into the lamellipod (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>), as has been reported for migrating epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib71\">Waterman-Storer and Salmon, 1997</a>). Like ER tubules, EB1 moved roughly radially though the ADZ and lamella, but at the lamellipod/lamella border the majority reoriented and moved parallel to the synapse edge or disappeared as they moved above the TIRF evanescent field (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). These findings suggest that ER tubules infrequently enter the lamellipod because microtubules cannot easily penetrate this thin, actin-dense compartment."

ER tubules undergoing retrograde movement in the lamella were commonly sandwiched between actin arcs (17 of 20 cells; Figure 2Biii, cyan arrows, and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>), and both moved at the same velocity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Moreover, the similar retrograde velocities of isolated STIM1/Orai1 puncta (47 \u00b1 3 nm/s, mean \u00b1 SEM, n\u00a0=\u00a024 particles; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and lamellar actin (36 \u00b1 6 nm/s, mean \u00b1 SEM, n\u00a0=\u00a018 cells; Figure 6F) suggest that retrograde actin flow also sweeps ER-PM junctions into the ADZ. Based on these results, we conclude that the ER at the synapse is dynamic, with peripheral extension on microtubules continually balanced by retraction imposed by retrograde actin flow."

                                "text": "A critical question is whether these effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on actin in Jurkat leukemic T cells extend to primary human T cells making synapses in a more physiological setting. A recent report has described WASp-associated actin foci in primary T cell synapses that were not detectable in Jurkat cells, suggesting that actin organization in primary T cells may be more complex than previously recognized (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kumari et al., 2015</a>). Jurkat cells also lack the lipid phosphatase PTEN, which may affect actin dynamics by enhancing PIP<sub>3</sub> accumulation in the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib60\">Shan et al., 2000</a>). Finally, primary T cells are normally activated by APCs displaying the integrin ICAM-1, which modestly alters actin organization and slows retrograde actin flow at the synapse (<a href=\"#bib10\">Comrie et al., 2015</a>). To investigate effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on actin dynamics in a more physiological model, we transduced primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphoblasts with Lifeact-GFP, a short F-actin binding peptide from Abp140 tethered to GFP (<a href=\"#bib56\">Riedl et al., 2008</a>). T lymphoblasts plated on anti-CD3- and ICAM-1-coated\u00a0coverslips formed a distinct lamellipod with rapid retrograde actin flow as described previously (<a href=\"#bib10\">Comrie et al., 2015</a>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal altered the distribution of synaptic actin and reduced ruffling and retrograde flow (20 of 21 cells; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). Kymograph analysis showed that on average, Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal slowed actin flow by 44% and Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> reperfusion restored it to 97% of the initial velocity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal narrowed the lamellipod by 61%, while Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> restoration returned the lamellipod to 82% of its initial width (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). T lymphoblasts on coverslips coated with anti-CD3 alone produced similar responses (<a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>, 40 of 45 cells, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Thus, primary T lymphoblasts and Jurkat T cells responded similarly to changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub>, supporting the use of Jurkat T cells as a physiologically relevant model system for studying the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on actin dynamics at the synapse."

Readdition of Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> initiated a rapid increase in the density of ER tubules in the lamella consistent with their reentry into the evanescent field, and tubules moved centripetally as retrograde actin flow resumed (6 of 6 cells; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>, and <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>).

We first examined the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on synaptic actin depolymerization in cells coexpressing F-tractin-P-tdTom and photoactivatable GFP-labeled actin (PAGFP-actin). After brief photoactivation of a small region, the GFP fluorescence indicates only F-actin, because monomeric PAGFP-actin rapidly escapes the region by diffusion; thus, the subsequent decay of fluorescence provides a measure of the actin depolymerization rate (<a href=\"#bib46\">McGrath et al., 1998</a>). 3\u20137 min after settling onto stimulatory coverslips, images of F-tractin-P-tdTom were used to identify cells with steady-state treadmilling actin and small (~1 by 3 \u00b5m) regions in the lamella and lamellipod were defined for photoactivation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, left, red ovals). PAGFP actin was first photoactivated in the presence Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> and again ~2\u2009min following Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal when F-actin had reached a new steady-state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>). After each photoactivation, the resulting GFP fluorescence was measured over time by widefield microscopy rather than TIRF in order to prevent any change in signal due to possible movement of actin in the Z direction, and translocation of the photoactivated region was used to measure centripetal velocity."

In the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub>, actin polymerization was strikingly different. Within 2\u2009s of photoactivation in the ADZ, fluorescence increased selectively in a narrow band around the periphery of the lamellipod (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Fluorescence at the periphery peaked within ~6\u2009s, then declined slightly as the combination of peripheral incorporation and centripetal flow labeled the entire lamellipod, generating a wide band of fluorescent actin that dropped off sharply at the lamella/lamellipod border (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,D</a>). In contrast, fluorescence in the lamella increased only minimally during the 30\u2009s following photoactivation. The reduced polymerization in the lamella was not due to the inability of PAGFP-actin to incorporate into lamellar structures (<a href=\"#bib79\">Yi et al., 2012</a>) because PAGFP-actin incorporated efficiently into the lamella in 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub>.

In a pioneering study, Bunnell et al demonstrated that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for actin accumulation and cell spreading during the early phase of synapse formation; however, the failure of the cells to spread in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> precluded study of calcium\u2019s effects on the mature synapse (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bunnell et al., 2001</a>). Likewise, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive proteins including L-plastin (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wabnitz et al., 2010</a>), gelsolin (<a href=\"#bib49\">Morley et al., 2007</a>), calpain (<a href=\"#bib70\">Watanabe et al., 2013</a>) and myosin IIA (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ilani et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Yi et al., 2012</a>) have been implicated in actin remodeling at the synapse, but in these studies protein expression levels or activity were perturbed prior to synapse initiation, and thus effects on cell adhesion and spreading could not be distinguished from possible effects on actin dynamics in the mature synapse. We were able to address the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the mature synapse by acutely blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx after the synapse was fully formed as indicated by its stable contact area, well-defined lamellipod and lamella actin zones, and retrograde actin flow. In both Jurkat cells and primary T lymphoblasts, Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal triggered similar changes in actin organization and retrograde flow. Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal slowed retrograde flow in the lamellipod to nearly the same degree in both cells (41% decrease in Jurkat versus 44% in primary T cells; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">2</a>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal diminished the lamellipod in primary T cells, reducing its width by 61%, while in Jurkat cells the effect was somewhat more pronounced with the lamellipod becoming indistinguishable from the rest of the actin network. Overall, these results demonstrate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects on actin organization and dynamics are not specific to Jurkat cells but apply also to primary T cells. Furthermore, T lymphoblasts responded similarly to Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal when stimulated on surfaces including ICAM-1 in order to more closely resemble an APC, indicating that our findings extend to more physiological surface interactions. New optical technologies such as light sheet microscopy may enable further studies of Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects on actin dynamics in the most physiological setting, at the synapse between a primary T cell and an APC\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib57\">Ritter et al., 2015</a>)."

Second, Ca<sup>2+</sup> accelerates actin depolymerization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), which is expected to enhance the rate of actin flow further by increasing the level of monomeric actin and therefore the rate of actin addition to free barbed ends at the lamellipod edge (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Overall, these findings demonstrate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> adds a second level of regulation to actin remodeling downstream of TCR triggering. The net effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is to suppress the density of F-actin at the synapse (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), which was somewhat surprising given that elevating intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been reported to increase the level of F-actin in unstimulated T cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dushek et al., 2008</a>). This discrepancy may have resulted from the different imaging methods that were used; flow cytometry may indicate an increased level of F-actin globally (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dushek et al., 2008</a>), while TIRF or confocal imaging at the cell footprint may instead detect a local decrease in F-actin at the synapse (this study). Alternatively, TCR triggering may initiate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive actin regulatory pathways that are quiescent in resting cells, and thus Ca<sup>2+</sup> engages a different set of actin remodeling proteins after TCR stimulation."

Ca<sup>2+</sup> drives centripetal actin flow in two ways: (1) by restricting polymerization to the lamellipod edge (green chevrons), it enforces vectorial movement of the actin network; and (2) by increasing the rate of depolymerization, it increases the pool of free actin monomers (grey chevrons), thus enhancing polymerization on free barbed ends at the lamellipod edge (green chevrons).

The extensive polymerization at the lamellipod edge is closely paralleled by the recruitment of the WAVE2/Abi1 complex to the periphery (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), where it presumably activates Arp2/3 to initiate actin polymerization and branching (<a href=\"#bib62\">Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007</a>). A central question arising from these findings is how Ca<sup>2+</sup> directs WAVE2/Abi1 to the periphery. One possible mechanism is suggested by the ability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to stimulate PI3K localization to the lamellipod of migrating cells, where generation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>) may recruit the WAVE2 complex to the membrane (<a href=\"#bib52\">Oikawa et al., 2004</a>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> may exert additional effects through its ability to promote GTP loading of Rac, a GTPase essential for WAVE2-mediated actin nucleation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fleming et al., 1999</a>). The mechanism by which Ca<sup>2+</sup> suppresses polymerization elsewhere in the lamella and lamellipod is also unknown, although Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive capping proteins expressed in T cells such as gelsolin (<a href=\"#bib80\">Yin, 1987</a>) or CapG (<a href=\"#bib83\">Yu et al., 1990</a>) are attractive candidates.

Our results provide the first view of ER dynamics at the synapse and how the actin cytoskeleton restricts both the ER and CRAC channel distribution to the cSMAC/ADZ. As the synapse forms, STIM1 and Orai1 appear in the cSMAC/ADZ by two mechanisms. The first is related to the movement of the centrosome and associated MTOC to the synapse, as EM tomography has shown enrichment of the ER around the centrosome at synaptic contact sites (<a href=\"#bib65\">Ueda et al., 2011</a>). This mechanism appears to account for the bulk of ER localization and STIM1-Orai1 complexes as cells settled onto coverslips. Once a stable synapse formed, microtubule extension carried ER tubules toward the periphery, and these were repeatedly returned to the ADZ by an advancing front of actin. A similar action of actin to oppose the extension of microtubules and associated ER tubules has also been described at the leading edge of migrating epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib63\">Terasaki and Reese, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Waterman-Storer and Salmon, 1997</a>). Our observations that STIM1/Orai1 puncta and actin move towards the ADZ at similar speeds suggest that nascent ER tubules may form ER-PM junctions in peripheral regions, which then enable the assembly of active STIM1-Orai1 complexes that traverse the lamella before they are collected in the ADZ. Interestingly, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to membrane phospholipids is thought to enhance TCR signaling by exposing membrane-associated CD3 ITAM motifs (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shi et al., 2013</a>). Thus, an intriguing possibility is that mobile CRAC channel complexes create local sites of high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> needed to fully activate mobile TCR microclusters."

This loop creates the potential for nonlinear effects, such that graded increases or decreases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> may act through actin to modulate TCR activity and bias the cell towards all-or-none, threshold-like behavior in response to antigen. At the same time, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx effectively limits the lifetime of active TCR microclusters by increasing the rate at which they are transported to the synapse center, where signaling is terminated (<a href=\"#bib82\">Yu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Varma et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yokosuka et al., 2005</a>). In addition, the accumulation of STIM1 and Orai1 in the ADZ reveals a new type of CRAC channel self-organization. At the level of single ER-PM junctions, STIM1 and Orai1 complexes self-organize through a diffusion trap mechanism based on STIM1 binding to the PM and Orai1 (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wu et al., 2014</a>). At the synapse CRAC channels self-organize in a second way, by promoting the retrograde flow of actin that concentrates ER-PM junctions and CRAC channels in the ADZ. Given evidence that Ca<sup>2+</sup> locally regulates exocytosis in T cells and mast cells (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pores-Fernando and Zweifach, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Holowka et al., 2012</a>) CRAC channel self-organization may ensure that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is optimally positioned to serve critical Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent functions including the directional secretion of cytokines like interleukin 2 and interferon-\u03b3 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huse et al., 2006</a>) that drive subsequent phases of the immune response."

In kymographs, each pixel represents the average intensity across the 5-pixel width of the scan line. Spatiotemporal image correlation spectroscopy (STICS) analysis was used to determine the direction and velocity of actin movement by applying an ImageJ plugin (STICS map jru v2, developed by Jay Unruh at Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, MO) based on methods developed by Hebert et al. (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hebert et al., 2005</a>). Sample sizes were determined based on previous in situ measurements of actin depolymerization rates (<a href=\"#bib64\">Theriot and Mitchison, 1991</a>) and live-cell imaging studies of the immune synapse (<a href=\"#bib2\">Babich et al., 2012</a>). To measure the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dependence of F-tractin-P fluorescence, F-tractin-P intensity was normalized to an average of the final five images collected in 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup>, at which time the fura-2 ratio had reached a minimum value of 0.39 \u00b1 0.04 (mean \u00b1 SEM, n\u00a0=\u00a026 cells). Data points represent the mean F-tractin-P fluorescence and fura-2 ratio when both signals were at steady-state and the sample size was selected to ensure that the cell population represented a broad range of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. PAGFP fluorescence decay was measured within an ROI encompassing the photoactivated region that was moved centripetally to remain centered on the fluorescent bar of actin. The time course was fitted by a single exponential function using IgorPro (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR). At each time point, the mean intensity across the width of the photoactivated bar was measured along a line perpendicular to the direction of movement, and displacement of the peak fluorescence value versus time was used to calculate velocity. To create fluorescence profile plots of PAGFP-actin incorporation, the fluorescence intensity as a function of radial position was calculated by averaging across 19 pixel-wide scan lines, subtracting the average of 10 scans acquired before photoactivation, and plotting the result relative to this pre-photoactivation signal."

The more specific question is how calcium entry through this channel alters actin and ER to drive specialization of the region (e.g., concentration of Orai Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, etc.) while recycling T cell receptors. The main conclusions are that actin reorganizes into a lamellipod with retrograde actin flow. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promotes actin depolymerization and localizes actin polymerization to the periphery of the lamellipod. Overall, the continuous actin reorganization drives microtubule bound ER and to the synapse center, presumably keeping the ER/PM junctions formed by Stim intact."

We have responded to the reviewers\u2019 comments by conducting a new series of experiments using human CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphoblasts plated on anti-CD3 alone as well as anti-CD3 + ICAM1, in collaboration with Dr. Janis Burkhardt\u2019s group. We find that Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal slows actin flow and reduces the extent of the lamellipod in a reversible fashion. These effects occur whether or not ICAM1 is present. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> affects actin organization and dynamics in primary human T cells as well as Jurkat T cells, although the effects are somewhat less dramatic in primary cells. These new results demonstrate that the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> are not specific to the Jurkat cell, and do extend to a more physiological synapse model. The new data are presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E and F</a> and <a href=\"#media7\">Videos 7</a> and <a href=\"#media8\">8</a> and discussed in the last paragraph of the subsection \u201cCalcium influx organizes actin at the synapse\u201d and in the second paragraph of the Discussion."

                    "text": "We believe the different distribution of WAVE2 in our study and that of Kumari et al. is due to the fact that the localization of WAVE2 varies at different times during synapse development. In the Kumari paper WAVE2 localization (which was punctate throughout the cell footprint) was shown only in a single cell imaged at a very early time point (2\u2019 after stimulation) when the cell was still in the spreading phase of synapse formation and the lamellipod had not yet formed (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B). In another study by Le Floc\u2019h et al. (Le Floc\u2019h et al. J. Exp. Med. 210:2721\u201337, 2013.), WAVE2 was also localized throughout the cell footprint at an early time, but became concentrated at the cell edge by 9 min, when the synapse had fully formed (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> of that paper). At later times (18-45 min), WAVE2 became most concentrated in the lamella/pSMAC where LFA-1 accumulates. Our results are consistent with these studies, in that we are specifically visualizing WAVE2 at 6 min after plating, which is shortly after the cell has fully spread, and we verify this by selecting cells that have a clearly lamellipod by phalloidin staining. This phase of synapse formation is equivalent to the 9 min time point in Le Floc\u2019h et al."
