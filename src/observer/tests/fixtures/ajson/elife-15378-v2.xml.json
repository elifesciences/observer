However, the underlying mechanisms regarding context-dependent motor learning and memory are largely unknown. Notably, contexts that are shown to be useful are often associated with different neural activity patterns of the sensorimotor cortex including the primary motor cortex (M1) and the premotor cortex (PM). For example, distinct motor memories for identical reaching movements can be created depending on whether the opposite arm is stationary or moving (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib39\">Nozaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib27\">Kadota et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib40\">Nozaki and Scott, 2009</xref>). Consistent with this finding, it has been reported that opposite arm movements alter M1 and PM activity during reaching movements (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib10\">Donchin et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib11\">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib4\">Cisek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib15\">Ganguly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib47\">Rokni et al., 2003</xref>). In agreement with the significant role of these brain areas in motor learning (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib27\">Kadota et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib13\">Gandolfo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib29\">Li et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib33\">Muellbacher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib1\">Arce et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib43\">Orban de Xivry et al., 2011</xref>;\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib42\">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib41\">2013</xref>), we hypothesized that, when a motor memory is formed under different activity patterns in the sensorimotor cortex associated with different contexts, a motor memory specific to this particular activity pattern is created. As a result, later reinstating this activity pattern in these areas should lead to automatic retrieval of the corresponding memory."

As a result, the size of the motor evoked potential induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation is increased or decreased by, respectively, anodal or cathodal tDCS during (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib38\">Nitsche et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib35\">2007</xref>) and even after the application of stimulation (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib36\">Nitsche and Paulus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib37\">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib54\">Siebner et al., 2004</xref>). This suggests that different brain activity patterns (i.e. specific to the polarity of the stimulation) could be artificially created by tDCS. We predicted that motor learning performed under different background activity patterns of the sensorimotor cortex created by tDCS would yield to the formation of separate motor memories. Participants were trained to perform reaching movements in the presence of two conflicting force fields while receiving tDCS on the sensorimotor cortex. Critically, training for each force field was always associated with a distinct tDCS polarity. We then examined if, after training, applying a particular tDCS polarity reactivated the motor memory associated with this polarity, despite no explicit contextual change."

Given our statistical power and effect size, this is exactly what would be expected. We compute the probability that there was an effect of stimulation polarity on force during the test period when the effect is observed in 3 out of the 4 groups. To compute this, we used a rationale provided by <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib25\">Ioannidis (2005)</xref> but adapted this justification to our positive results, as was done by <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib28\">Lakens and Evers (2014)</xref>. Given a power of 0.8, the probability of observing three significant and one non-significant finding if there is a true effect is as follows (Type 2 error): 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 0.2 = 0.1024. Any of the four groups could yield a non-significant finding, so the a-priori likelihood of finding three out of four significant effects is 0.4096. We also needed to find the probability of observing these results if there was no effect (null hypothesis is true). Given a Type 1 error of 0.05 (significance threshold), this probability is as follows: p\u00a0=\u00a00.05 \u00d7 0.05 \u00d7 0.05 \u00d7 0.95 = 0.00011875. Again, because any group could be non-significant, the probability of finding these results if there is no effect is p\u00a0=\u00a00.000475. With these data, we can compute the positive predictive value (PPV)\u00a0(<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib25\">Ioannidis, 2005</xref>). This number represents the post-study probability that the effect is true: PPV = 0.4096/(0.4096 + 0.000475) = 0.998. That is, the likelihood that there is a true effect despite the fact that one of the four groups yielded a non-significant effect is 99.8%."

To investigate the amount of interference between the two perturbations, we measured the lateral deviations of the first trial during rightward and leftward force-field training. With this measure, higher interference is associated with higher lateral deviation on the first trial. When comparing this measure between the T-T, S-T, and T-S groups, we did not detect any significant differences in lateral deviation during the first trial [repeated measures 3-way ANOVA: F(2,45) = 2.369, p\u00a0=\u00a00.105, <inline-formula><math id=\"inf29\"><mrow/></math></inline-formula> = 0.088] (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6b</xref>). However, when the data from the T-T and T-S groups were grouped together (they received the same training and stimulation during the training period), lateral deviations during the first trial were significantly smaller (i.e., less interference) for groups who received active tDCS whilst training (T-T and T-S groups) than for the sham group (S-T group) [main effect of group: F(1,46) = 4.435 p\u00a0=\u00a00.041, <inline-formula><math id=\"inf30\"><mrow/></math></inline-formula> = 0.10; interaction between group and force-field direction (or tDCS polarity): F(1,46) = 0.148, p\u00a0=\u00a00.708, <inline-formula><math id=\"inf31\"><mrow/></math></inline-formula> = 0.003].

Although the present study only focused on the immediate modulating effect of tDCS on neural activity, tDCS also has long-lasting or plastic effects on the cortex (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib34\">Nitsche et al., 2008</xref>), raising questions as to whether activity patterns in the sensorimotor cortex were similar during the training and testing periods. For example, M1 excitability remains elevated, even after anodal tDCS termination, when stimulus duration is sufficiently long (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib35\">Nitsche et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib34\">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib36\">Nitsche and Paulus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib37\">2001</xref>). However, we considered that any long-lasting effects did not play a dominant role in our results. First, as tDCS polarity switched every 2 min, durations were too short to induce long-lasting effects on cortical excitability. Second, as anodal and cathodal tDCS alternated, any long-lasting effects, including homeostatic plasticity (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib54\">Siebner et al., 2004</xref>), were likely cancelled out."

This manipulation sheds light on the possibility that manipulating the formation and recollection of various memories, including declarative and other types of motor memories (e.g., visuomotor rotation task or sequence learning), can be achieved by artificially changing activity patterns of the corresponding brain region during the learning period. Thus, our novel tDCS application opens up new avenues for implementing tDCS in human memory research."

The values before and after data collection were 3.86 \u00b1 1.09 and 3.38 \u00b1 2.07 k\u03a9, respectively.

The test period consisted of two repetitions of anodal-cathodal tDCS (ACAC subgroup) or cathodal-anodal tDCS (CACA subgroup). To test the effect of subgroup and stimulation polarity on the residuals of the force output during the test period, a repeated measures 3-way ANOVA was conducted with within-subject factors period (the first 2 blocks or last 2 blocks of the test period) and block order (the first or second block for each half of the test period, during which the same tDCS polarity was received in both halves of the test period) and between-subject factor subgroup (ACAC or CACA) (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</xref>). In this ANOVA, the factor block order can be assimilated with stimulation-induced polarity-dependent changes in force output. Indeed, tDCS polarity was identical between the first and third blocks of the test period (where the block order factor has the same value) and different during the second and fourth blocks of the test period (where the block order factor had another value). Given that the association between block and polarity was opposite between subgroups [the first (or second) block for the ACAC subgroup corresponded to anodal (or cathodal) stimulation and vice versa for the CACA subgroup], we expected, if tDCS influenced the force output, a significant interaction between subgroup and block order. In addition, if the force output varies with tDCS polarity in each subgroup, we expect a main effect of block order for each subgroup separately. The same analysis was used for hand velocity during the test period. We used a 4-way ANOVA where the between-subject factor group was added to contrast the effect of active and sham stimulation (T-T vs S-T or T-T vs T-S) and to contrast the effect of stimulation site (T-T vs PPC)."

While early results emphasized how sensorimotor adaptation was relatively impervious to context (e.g., color cues), recent work has identified a number of conditions in which contextual cues can be quite powerful. The current study takes the question of context in an entirely new direction, at least within the world of human motor learning, asking if modulation of the (endogenous) neural state can serve as a sufficient contextual cue. To this end, the authors use tDCS to establish the context, associating a force field in one direction with anodal tDCS and a force field in the opposite direction with cathodal tDCS. Of special note here is that the participants are completely unaware of the \"cue\", something that is not (usually) possible in studies involving behavioral manipulations of context."

While our requests for revision are relatively modest, there is one major, indeed critical, issue that needs to be addressed. While the leftward and rightward force fields induce significant changes in performance, the context effect is relatively small (estimate of about 5% of the force difference). In itself, this is not a concern if the effect is robust-that the authors see any effect here is impressive. However, the key analysis seems overly complex with a lot of parameters. The authors fit a 5-parameter function to every noisy individual-subject test-period data set, the result of which is there are over 400 free parameters (5params/subject x [48 subjects in the main experiments + 36 subjects in the controls], or about 80 in each experiment) to \"model\" the decay curves in the data. The residuals of these models serve as the primary \"data\" for the main analysis. With this analysis, one would want to see some graphic depiction of the parameters of the individual double-exponential fit. But, as noted below, we believe there is a better solution."

Our technique is guided by the fact that simple decay of motor memories should follow an exponential function (single or double) and that any deviation from such exponential should be due to the modulation of the force pattern by the polarity of the simulation. Therefore, we believe that calculating the residual by fitting the data with 2 exponential curves did not cause artificial stimulation-dependent modulation of the force but allowed us to eliminate the decaying component and slowly changing force output trends. Indeed, as shown in the figure below, the presence of force output modulation was not affected, even when fitting the data with a single exponential curve (see figure below and <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</xref> in the paper). The use of a double exponential curve function reduced the magnitude of the residuals, because it contributes to eliminate the slow drift in force with the data. Nevertheless, independently of the use of a single or double exponential function, we observed significant polarity-dependent modulation of the residuals, indicating strong evidence for the presence of this effect. The analysis of the residuals appears to us simpler than the bootstrap analysis suggested by the reviewers. In addition, it allows us to test for the existence of polarity-dependent changes in force output for each subgroup separately. Therefore, we took extra care in explaining this analysis into details and in describing the expected polarity-dependent changes in the residuals (third paragraph of the Results section, and <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</xref>)."

It should be noted that, as \u2206Force was calculated from data recorded on different experimental groups, a bootstrap method was necessary to use the \u2206Force for statistical testing. Therefore, rather than simplifying the analysis, the model-free approach makes it more complicated. Specifically, we created bootstrap samples of \u2206Force (subtracting the CACA data from ACAC data for the T-T, S-T, and T-S groups) to obtain a mean and standard deviation of the resampled data (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3A, B, and C</xref> in the revised manuscript).

If the same participants had experienced both the T-T and S-T conditions, an ANOVA would have been appropriate. However, since T-T and S-T were different experimental groups in the present study, subtracted data could not be created for each participant. Thus, in order to perform the suggested ANOVA, the only possibility would be to subtract the averaged S-T data from each participant\u2019s data for the T-T group."

First, an ANOVA on the residuals obtained as subtraction of averaged data of S-T group from each data of T-T group would not consider any variability in the S-T group. Second, since decay patterns differed from participant to participant, it would be difficult to determine what the residuals obtained by this way actually represent. Third, using the S-T group decay pattern as a baseline for the T-T group was not appropriate because each group received a different training protocol, which could influence the decay pattern (e.g., time constant). We believe the subtraction of the ACAC subgroup data from the CACA subgroup data (i.e., \u2206Force) was more appropriate to eliminate the effect of natural decay because they received the same training protocol. It should be noted that since the data were collected from different groups, a bootstrapping (or permutation) method was necessary for the statistical test on \u2206Force."

These contrasts were already mentioned in the original manuscript; however, with this revision we tried to explicitly demonstrate them. Specifically, we have created a plot to demonstrate the difference in \u2206Force between the T-T and S-T groups (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4A, B</xref>). We also created a plot for the T-T and T-S groups (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4C, D</xref>), and for the T-T and PPC groups (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5E, F</xref>). These new plots clearly indicate the presence of different modulation patterns between the T-T and other control groups. In this revision, we used a permutation test to statistically assess the effect of block order and period (please see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</xref> for the definitions of block order and period; we have also revised the Statistics section to clearly explain the adopted method) on \u2206Force and the changes from the 1<sup>st</sup> to 2<sup>nd</sup>, from the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup>, and from the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> block. Using a permutation test did not substantially change the results."
