Like all small GTPases, Rab proteins cycle between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound state. The cycling is tightly regulated and mediated by two families of enzymes: guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that catalyze the GDP/GTP exchange and GTPase activating proteins that stimulate GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib45\">Stenmark, 2009</xref>). Additionally, a variety of different effector proteins interact specifically with GTP-bound Rab proteins and mediate their versatile physiological roles in membrane trafficking, including budding of vesicles from a donor membrane, directed transport through the cell and finally tethering and fusion with a target membrane (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib12\">Grosshans et al., 2006</xref>). Especially in long-distance vesicular transport processes (e.g. in neuronal axons and dendrites), directed vesicular transport along cytoskeletal tracks appears to be an obvious mechanism and, consistently, different effector proteins have been reported to link Rab proteins to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib22\">Kevenaar and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib16\">Horgan and McCaffrey, 2011</xref>)."

The sequence alignments of different Rab proteins clearly shows that the interacting residues of Rab proteins with Micals (red residues) are highly conserved (orange residues) in Rab1 and Rab8 family members (Rab1a, Rab1b, Rab35, Rab8, Rab10, Rab13, Rab15), but not in other Rabs (below the black line). (<bold>b</bold>) In all structures of Rab proteins in complex with Mical-cL, the N-termini of the Rab proteins point towards a negatively charged patch of Mical-cL (Rabs are shown in cartoon representation as above; the surface of Mical-cL is colored by charge, red \u2013 negative charge, blue \u2013 positive charge). The sequence of the N-terminal residues of each Rab protein is shown below the corresponding structure: Whereas Rab1 contains a negatively charged glutamate at position 4, Rab8 and Rab10 contain one or two lysine residues at position 3 or at position 3 and 4, respectively. Consistently, the negatively charged N-terminus of Rab1 seems to repel \u03b1-helices 1 and 2 of Mical-cL and they adopt a conformation slightly further away from Rab1 compared to Rab8 and Rab10 (also see (<bold>a</bold>)). However, after mutating the 4 N-terminal residues of Rab1 to the corresponding sequence of Rab8 (the resulting chimera is called Rab1<sub>R8N</sub>), the structure of Rab1<sub>R8N</sub>:Mical-cL shows a similar conformation of \u03b1-helices 1 and 2 as in the structure of Rab8:Mical-cL. (<bold>c</bold>) Consistently, ITC measurements show that the affinity of binding increases approximately five-fold after mutating the N-terminal residues (Rab1:Mical-cL: K<sub>D</sub> = 5.2 \u00b5M; Rab1<sub>R8N</sub>:Mical-cL: K<sub>D</sub> = 1.1 \u00b5M; Rab8:Mical-cL: K<sub>D</sub> = 0.23 \u00b5M)."

                                "text": "The specificity of effector proteins towards certain Rab families is generally achieved via interaction with regions termed Rab subfamily motifs (RabSFs) 1\u20134 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib23\">Khan and M\u00e9n\u00e9trey, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib29\">Moore et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib36\">Pereira-Leal and Seabra, 2000</xref>). In the Rab:Mical-cL structures, we observed extensive interaction of Mical-cL with RabSF1 (Tyr6, Asp7, Leu9, Lys11 in Rab10) and (less interactions) with RabSF2 (Asp31, Ser40 in Rab10). Accordingly, the sequence alignment of different Rab proteins (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5</xref>) shows strong conservation of the interacting amino acids within these motifs amongst Rab1 (Rab1a/b, Rab35) and Rab8 (Rab8a/b, Rab10, Rab13, Rab15) family members that interact with bMERB domains, but not for other Rab proteins (a comparative scheme of the residues involved in interactions in the different complexes is shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a</xref>). Since the interacting residues in the RabSF1 and RabSF2 regions are strongly conserved between both Rab1 and Rab8 families, this did not explain the observed preference of the RBD towards the Rab8 family. However, we observed that the main chain atoms of the N-terminal residues preceding the RabSF1 motif can be traced in the electron density and seem to interact with amino acids within \u03b1-helix 1 and 2 of Mical-cL, even though the electron density in this region did not allow a precise localization of the side chains. In contrast to the main interacting helix \u03b13, which adopts a similar position in all three structures, we observed slightly different orientations of the \u03b1-helices 1 and 2, adopting a position slightly further away from Rab1 compared to Rab8 and Rab10 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5a</xref>). Interestingly, whereas Rab1 contains a glutamate near the N-terminus (Glu4), all Rab8 family members contain one or (in the case of Rab10) two lysine residues in this region that point towards a negatively charged patch in Mical-cL (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5b</xref>). Additionally, Rab35 contains an Arg residue within this N-terminal region and also displays a slightly higher affinity towards Mical-cL compared to Rab1 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</xref>). We therefore tested whether these N-terminal residues of the Rab proteins might determine the specificity of bMERB domains towards Rab8 and its homologues rather than Rab1. We constructed a chimera of Rab1 containing the 4 N-terminal aa of Rab8, thus exchanging the negatively charged glutamate for a positively charged lysine. The x-ray crystallographic structure of this Rab1 chimera (termed Rab1<sub>R8N</sub>) in complex with Mical-cL clearly showed that the helices 1 and 2 move closer and adopt a similar conformation as observed in the structures of Rab8:Mical-cL and Rab10:Mical-cL (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5a</xref>). Additionally, ITC measurements showed that the chimera had an approximately five-fold increased binding affinity compared to Rab1 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5c</xref>). In contrast to Rab1, the chimera Rab1<sub>R8N</sub> bound both EHBP1 and EHBP1L1 in aSEC experiments (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b</xref>), thus clearly indicating that the N-terminus is important for the interaction and contributes to the observed specificity of bMERB domains towards Rab proteins."

Whereas one Rab protein binds to \u03b1-helix 1 and the first half of \u03b1-helix 2 (Mical-1<sub>918-991</sub>, binding site 1, blue), the second molecule of Rab10 binds the second half of \u03b1-helix 2 and \u03b1-helix 3 (Mical-1<sub>994-1060</sub>, binding site 2, green). Upon superimposition of both binding sites, the strong similarity becomes obvious and the helices from both binding sites adopt very similar positions. Furthermore, the interactions are highly similar in both cases as can be seen in the close-up view on the right (similar Rab-interacting residues within binding site 1 and 2 are shown in blue and green, respectively). (<bold>b</bold>) The strong conservation of interacting residues within both halves of the Mical-1 bMERB domain can also be seen in the sequence alignment of the N- and C-terminal halves. Additionally, the alignment shows that \u03b1-helix 1 and the first half of \u03b1-helix 2 (binding site 1) correspond to the second half of \u03b1-helix 2 and \u03b1-helix 3 (binding site 2), respectively (the secondary structure is indicated above and below the corresponding sequences, interacting and conserved residues within binding site 1 and 2 are highlighted in blue and green). (<bold>c</bold>) Whereas the whole bMERB domain of Mical-1 can bind two Rab molecules (left), deletion of either \u03b1-helix 1 (middle) or \u03b1-helix 3 (right) impairs binding to binding site 1 or 2, respectively. This effect could be shown both by aSEC and ITC (note the enthalpy-driven high-affinity binding site 2 and the entropy-driven lower-affinity binding site 1 that can be clearly distinguished, a schematic drawing of the different constructs is shown within the aSEC graphs). (<bold>d</bold>) Based on the observations made above, we propose that both binding sites must have evolved from a common ancestor by gene duplication of a 200\u00a0bp DNA fragment coding for the original gene product, a single \u03b1-hairpin. The fusion lead to the arrangement of the \u03b1-helices observed in bMERB domains, with the central \u03b1-helix 2 as a continuous connecting helix of both repeats, similar to the architecture of spectrin repeats."

Furthermore, we show that at least some of these domains contain two separate binding sites for Rab-proteins, suggesting previously unknown functions, as discussed below.

Specificity-determining interactions were seen between the effector domains and the RabSF1 and RabSF2 motifs. However, additional interactions were required to increase the specificity even further, thus allowing the proteins to distinguish Rab1- and Rab8-family members. In this regard, we showed that the N-terminal residues preceding the RabSF1 motif contribute to this specificity, an observation that has previously not been made in other Rab:effector interactions. However, as alluded to in the introduction, the presence of multiple isoforms (e.g. Mical-1, Mical-L1 etc.) of the proteins, as well as the demonstrated presence of two separate binding sites, might also point towards a broader and more diverse Rab-binding spectrum and is the subject of ongoing research in our work."

Further comparison with other known Rab:effector structures showed that the main interacting helix in Rab:bMERB complexes (e.g. \u03b1-helix 3 in Mical-cL) adopts a similar position to that of the main interacting helix in the structures of Rab27:Slp2-a (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib4\">Chavas et al., 2008</xref>), Rab27:Slac2a/melanophilin (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib26\">Kukimoto-Niino et al., 2008</xref>) and Rab3:Rabphilin-3a (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib34\">Ostermeier and Brunger, 1999</xref>) (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</xref> for a comparison). Interestingly, in all three examples, the Arg/Lys contacting Asp45 in our Mical:Rab structures is also conserved in these effector proteins, and the Asp/Asn following this basic residue and contacting Gln61 in Rabs is conserved in both Slp2-a and Slac2a. Intriguingly, these effector domains also display similar binding affinities as bMERB domains towards their cognate Rabs (K<sub>D</sub> = 13.4 nM for Rab27:Slp2-a, K<sub>D</sub> = 112 nM for Rab27:Slac2-a/melanophilin) (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib9\">Fukuda, 2006</xref>), and these are amongst the highest affinities observed for Rab:effector interactions."

Such functions could include linking Rab-decorated vesicles to a target membrane or other vesicles via a central bivalent effector.

In fact, the presence of one high affinity and one low affinity Rab binding site as observed in some bMERB effectors could further enhance the formation of Rab microdomains: Whereas the Rab bound to the high affinity site would essentially stay bound within physiologically relevant timescales, the additional Rab protein recruited by the low affinity site could dissociate again and recruit another effector molecule via the high affinity site, thus helping to concentrate Rabs within small areas on the membrane."

The possible importance of such concerted membrane recruitment cascades of Rabs and other proteins involved in membrane trafficking has been previously highlighted for Mical-L1 connecting Rab35 and Rab8, and this was aptly referred to as a membrane hub (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib38\">Rahajeng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib10\">Giridharan et al., 2012</xref>).

In this work, the authors concluded that dimerization of Mical-L1 allows a concerted recruitment and binding of two separate Rabs to an effector dimer.

The strong sequence homology of different bMERB domains including both binding sites and the fact that all Rab8 family proteins reported to interact with Micals/EHBPs are implicated in different steps of endocytic trafficking (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib52\">Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014</xref>) as well as previously published data thus points towards an important function of Micals/EHBPs in sorting of endocytic cargo with different destinations in the cell."

Because of the strong similarity between the repeats of the different isoforms of Micals and EHBPs, but less similarity between both repeats within the bMERB domains (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1b</xref>), we suggest that the duplication must have occurred early in evolution in one common ancestor bMERB domain. The two repeats have since diverged in terms of overall sequence, but the ability to bind Rab proteins has remained in at least some cases, as shown in this study. Exploration of the binding specificity of both binding sites of the bMERB proteins towards Rabs (and possibly other GTPases [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib38\">Rahajeng et al., 2012</xref>]) will therefore be of great interest."

However, binding multiple Rabs still implies a link to functions in membrane trafficking rather than other cellular processes. What is novel or unknown in that sense? I agree with the view that I suspect informs this statement, which is that we don't really understand what the Mical/EHBP proteins do, or how Rab-binding controls their function. Multivalent Rab binding might allow one effector integrate inputs from different Rabs at one membrane or perhaps different membranes bearing different Rabs.

If these were GTPases of different families, e.g. Rab and Rho or Ras, then the argument would be clear. However, binding multiple Rabs still implies a link to functions in membrane trafficking rather than other cellular processes. What is novel or unknown in that sense? I agree with the view that I suspect informs this statement, which is that we don't really understand what the Mical/EHBP proteins do, or how Rab-binding controls their function. Multivalent Rab binding might allow one effector integrate inputs from different Rabs at one membrane or perhaps different membranes bearing different Rabs. Perhaps something along these lines could be referred to at the end of the Abstract.</italic> "

As we discuss later in the manuscript, this might include functions \u201cin sorting cargo and/or linking different endosomal trafficking pathways regulated by different Rab proteins\u201d, however we have no experimental data at this point that would allow us to do more than speculate."
