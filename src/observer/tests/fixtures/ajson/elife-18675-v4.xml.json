In this study, we have thoroughly characterized a Rab effector domain that is present in proteins of the Mical and EHBP families, both known to act in endosomal trafficking. Within our study, we show that these effectors display a preference for Rab8 family proteins (Rab8, 10, 13 and 15) and that some of the effector domains can bind two Rab proteins via separate binding sites. Structural analysis allowed us to explain the specificity towards Rab8 family members and the presence of two similar Rab binding sites that must have evolved via gene duplication. This study is the first to thoroughly characterize a Rab effector protein that contains two separate Rab binding sites within a single domain, allowing Micals and EHBPs to bind two Rabs simultaneously, thus suggesting previously unknown functions of these effector molecules in endosomal trafficking."

In this study, we have thoroughly characterized a Rab effector domain that is present in proteins of the Mical and EHBP families, both known to act in endosomal trafficking. Within our study, we show that these effectors display a preference for Rab8 family proteins (Rab8, 10, 13 and 15) and that some of the effector domains can bind two Rab proteins via separate binding sites. Structural analysis allowed us to explain the specificity towards Rab8 family members and the presence of two similar Rab binding sites that must have evolved via gene duplication. This study is the first to thoroughly characterize a Rab effector protein that contains two separate Rab binding sites within a single domain, allowing Micals and EHBPs to bind two Rabs simultaneously, thus suggesting previously unknown functions of these effector molecules in endosomal trafficking."

Like all small GTPases, Rab proteins cycle between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound state. The cycling is tightly regulated and mediated by two families of enzymes: guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that catalyze the GDP/GTP exchange and GTPase activating proteins that stimulate GTP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib45\">Stenmark, 2009</a>). Additionally, a variety of different effector proteins interact specifically with GTP-bound Rab proteins and mediate their versatile physiological roles in membrane trafficking, including budding of vesicles from a donor membrane, directed transport through the cell and finally tethering and fusion with a target membrane (<a href=\"#bib12\">Grosshans et al., 2006</a>). Especially in long-distance vesicular transport processes (e.g. in neuronal axons and dendrites), directed vesicular transport along cytoskeletal tracks appears to be an obvious mechanism and, consistently, different effector proteins have been reported to link Rab proteins to the cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kevenaar and Hoogenraad, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Horgan and McCaffrey, 2011</a>)."

We therefore set out to systematically confirm and quantify the interaction of 5 of these Rab proteins with the bMERB domains of Mical-1, Mical-3, Mical-cL, EHBP1 and EHBP1L1 via analytical size exclusion chromatography (aSEC) (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, the aSEC data is shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In these experiments, stable complex formation was detected with Rab8, Rab10, Rab13 and Rab15 (since Rab8, Rab10, Rab13 and Rab15 are closely related in amino acid sequence, we refer to them as the Rab8 family [<a href=\"#bib24\">Kl\u00f6pper et al., 2012</a>]). Rab1, however, failed to form stable complexes with bMERB-domain proteins, indicating low affinity."

Therefore, we set out to test whether these motifs can be prenylated <i>in vitro</i> and if prenylation is responsible and necessary for correct intracellular localization. <i>In vitro</i>, both proteins can be farnesylated and geranylgeranylated by FTase and GGTase I, respectively. However, in accordance with the C-terminal amino acids of the CaaX-boxes being glutamine or serine (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhang and Casey, 1996</a>), we observed preferential farnesylation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). Using constructs containing the RBD with or without the CaaX-boxes, we next looked at the intracellular localization. These experiments clearly showed a CaaX-box dependent localization of both proteins to intracellular structures resembling endosomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>), as previously reported for the full length proteins (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shi et al., 2010</a>).

After incubation of the purified proteins including the CaaX-motifs (theoretical masses of the purified proteins: 22253.3 Da (EHBP1); 22214.0 Da (EHBP1L1); left panel) with Farnesytransferase (FTase, middle panel) or Geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase, right panel) farnesylation/geranylgeranylation lead to an increase in mass of 205.4/272.5 Da, respectively. Note that farnesylation, in contrast to geranylgeranylation, appears to be more efficient under similar conditions and goes to completion. This is in agreement with the sequence of the CaaX-motifs in both proteins containing a Gln/Ser at their C-terminus which has been shown to favor farnesylation. (<b>b</b>) Whereas the constructs containing the bMERB domain and the CaaX-motif (EHBP1<sub>1047-1231</sub>, EHBP1L1<sub>1340-1523</sub>) localize to intracellular structures resembling endosomes, deletion of the CaaX-motif (\u2206CaaX) leads to a cytosolic distribution for both EHBP1 and EHBP1L1 (Scale bars: 10 \u00b5m). (<b>c</b>) Both EGFP-EHBP1<sub>1047-1231</sub> and EGFP-EHBP1L1<sub>1340-1523</sub> (upper panel) show strong colocalisation with mCherry-Rab8<sub>Q67L</sub> and mCherry-Rab10<sub>Q68L</sub> (middle panel) as indicated in the merged images (lower panel).

We consequently also tested whether the effector proteins might be able to simultaneously bind two different Rab proteins in a 1:1:1 (RabX:effector:RabY) complex using both Rab8 and Rab13 and the corresponding aSEC experiments clearly confirmed the formation of a ternary complex of Rab8:Mical-1:Rab13 as well as Rab8:EHBP1L1:Rab13 (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

                                "text": "The specificity of effector proteins towards certain Rab families is generally achieved via interaction with regions termed Rab subfamily motifs (RabSFs) 1\u20134 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Khan and M\u00e9n\u00e9trey, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Moore et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pereira-Leal and Seabra, 2000</a>). In the Rab:Mical-cL structures, we observed extensive interaction of Mical-cL with RabSF1 (Tyr6, Asp7, Leu9, Lys11 in Rab10) and (less interactions) with RabSF2 (Asp31, Ser40 in Rab10). Accordingly, the sequence alignment of different Rab proteins (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) shows strong conservation of the interacting amino acids within these motifs amongst Rab1 (Rab1a/b, Rab35) and Rab8 (Rab8a/b, Rab10, Rab13, Rab15) family members that interact with bMERB domains, but not for other Rab proteins (a comparative scheme of the residues involved in interactions in the different complexes is shown in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). Since the interacting residues in the RabSF1 and RabSF2 regions are strongly conserved between both Rab1 and Rab8 families, this did not explain the observed preference of the RBD towards the Rab8 family. However, we observed that the main chain atoms of the N-terminal residues preceding the RabSF1 motif can be traced in the electron density and seem to interact with amino acids within \u03b1-helix 1 and 2 of Mical-cL, even though the electron density in this region did not allow a precise localization of the side chains. In contrast to the main interacting helix \u03b13, which adopts a similar position in all three structures, we observed slightly different orientations of the \u03b1-helices 1 and 2, adopting a position slightly further away from Rab1 compared to Rab8 and Rab10 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). Interestingly, whereas Rab1 contains a glutamate near the N-terminus (Glu4), all Rab8 family members contain one or (in the case of Rab10) two lysine residues in this region that point towards a negatively charged patch in Mical-cL (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). Additionally, Rab35 contains an Arg residue within this N-terminal region and also displays a slightly higher affinity towards Mical-cL compared to Rab1 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We therefore tested whether these N-terminal residues of the Rab proteins might determine the specificity of bMERB domains towards Rab8 and its homologues rather than Rab1. We constructed a chimera of Rab1 containing the 4 N-terminal aa of Rab8, thus exchanging the negatively charged glutamate for a positively charged lysine. The x-ray crystallographic structure of this Rab1 chimera (termed Rab1<sub>R8N</sub>) in complex with Mical-cL clearly showed that the helices 1 and 2 move closer and adopt a similar conformation as observed in the structures of Rab8:Mical-cL and Rab10:Mical-cL (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). Additionally, ITC measurements showed that the chimera had an approximately five-fold increased binding affinity compared to Rab1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). In contrast to Rab1, the chimera Rab1<sub>R8N</sub> bound both EHBP1 and EHBP1L1 in aSEC experiments (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>), thus clearly indicating that the N-terminus is important for the interaction and contributes to the observed specificity of bMERB domains towards Rab proteins."

Whereas one Rab protein binds to \u03b1-helix 1 and the first half of \u03b1-helix 2 (Mical-1<sub>918-991</sub>, binding site 1, blue), the second molecule of Rab10 binds the second half of \u03b1-helix 2 and \u03b1-helix 3 (Mical-1<sub>994-1060</sub>, binding site 2, green). Upon superimposition of both binding sites, the strong similarity becomes obvious and the helices from both binding sites adopt very similar positions. Furthermore, the interactions are highly similar in both cases as can be seen in the close-up view on the right (similar Rab-interacting residues within binding site 1 and 2 are shown in blue and green, respectively). (<b>b</b>) The strong conservation of interacting residues within both halves of the Mical-1 bMERB domain can also be seen in the sequence alignment of the N- and C-terminal halves. Additionally, the alignment shows that \u03b1-helix 1 and the first half of \u03b1-helix 2 (binding site 1) correspond to the second half of \u03b1-helix 2 and \u03b1-helix 3 (binding site 2), respectively (the secondary structure is indicated above and below the corresponding sequences, interacting and conserved residues within binding site 1 and 2 are highlighted in blue and green). (<b>c</b>) Whereas the whole bMERB domain of Mical-1 can bind two Rab molecules (left), deletion of either \u03b1-helix 1 (middle) or \u03b1-helix 3 (right) impairs binding to binding site 1 or 2, respectively. This effect could be shown both by aSEC and ITC (note the enthalpy-driven high-affinity binding site 2 and the entropy-driven lower-affinity binding site 1 that can be clearly distinguished, a schematic drawing of the different constructs is shown within the aSEC graphs). (<b>d</b>) Based on the observations made above, we propose that both binding sites must have evolved from a common ancestor by gene duplication of a 200\u00a0bp DNA fragment coding for the original gene product, a single \u03b1-hairpin. The fusion lead to the arrangement of the \u03b1-helices observed in bMERB domains, with the central \u03b1-helix 2 as a continuous connecting helix of both repeats, similar to the architecture of spectrin repeats."

Specificity-determining interactions were seen between the effector domains and the RabSF1 and RabSF2 motifs. However, additional interactions were required to increase the specificity even further, thus allowing the proteins to distinguish Rab1- and Rab8-family members. In this regard, we showed that the N-terminal residues preceding the RabSF1 motif contribute to this specificity, an observation that has previously not been made in other Rab:effector interactions. However, as alluded to in the introduction, the presence of multiple isoforms (e.g. Mical-1, Mical-L1 etc.) of the proteins, as well as the demonstrated presence of two separate binding sites, might also point towards a broader and more diverse Rab-binding spectrum and is the subject of ongoing research in our work."

On the other hand, multivalent Rab effector proteins have been described previously (examples are Rab4 and Rab5 binding to Rabaptin-5 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Vitale et al., 1998</a>), Rab6 and Rab11 binding to Rab6IP1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Miserey-Lenkei et al., 2007</a>) or the extreme case of Gcc185 with five sites binding to Rab1a/b, Rab2a/b, Rab6a/b, Rab9a/b, Rab15, Rab27, Rab30, Rab33, Rab35 and Rab36 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hayes et al., 2009</a>). However, all of these effectors contain separate Rab-binding domains, each in turn only binding one Rab protein. The work presented constitutes the first description of two Rab proteins binding a single effector domain."

Such functions could include linking Rab-decorated vesicles to a target membrane or other vesicles via a central bivalent effector. On the other hand, concerted Rab cascades and feedback loops have been observed with effector domains fused to GEFs or GAPs of one Rab acting upstream or downstream of a second Rab, helping to recruit or remove Rab proteins from a certain membrane (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pfeffer, 2013</a>). Bivalent effectors could act in a similar manner in a positive feedback loop, initially being recruited by activated Rab proteins and subsequently helping in the\u00a0recruitment and stabilization of further Rabs at this site to establish Rab membrane microdomains (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pfeffer, 2013</a>). In fact, the presence of one high affinity and one low affinity Rab binding site as observed in some bMERB effectors could further enhance the formation of Rab microdomains: Whereas the Rab bound to the high affinity site would essentially stay bound within physiologically relevant timescales, the additional Rab protein recruited by the low affinity site could dissociate again and recruit another effector molecule via the high affinity site, thus helping to concentrate Rabs within small areas on the membrane."

The possible importance of such concerted membrane recruitment cascades of Rabs and other proteins involved in membrane trafficking has been previously highlighted for Mical-L1 connecting Rab35 and Rab8, and this was aptly referred to as a membrane hub (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rahajeng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Giridharan et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, recent studies on Mical-L2 dependent GLUT4 translocation showed that trafficking was dependent on a concerted action of Rab8 and Rab13 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sun et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2016</a>). In another study it was shown that Mical-L1 is recruited to recycling endosomes by Rab35 and subsequently recruits other Rab proteins (Rab8, Rab13 and Rab36) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kobayashi et al., 2014</a>). In this work, the authors concluded that dimerization of Mical-L1 allows a concerted recruitment and binding of two separate Rabs to an effector dimer. However, our data now show how the 2 separate binding sites presumably also present in Mical-L1 and Mical-L2 (see <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) could help in establishing this concerted action of two Rabs by connecting them via one bivalent effector protein in an (intermediate) 1:1:1 complex, thus explaining for the first time the structural and biochemical basis of the Rab hub function. The strong sequence homology of different bMERB domains including both binding sites and the fact that all Rab8 family proteins reported to interact with Micals/EHBPs are implicated in different steps of endocytic trafficking (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014</a>) as well as previously published data thus points towards an important function of Micals/EHBPs in sorting of endocytic cargo with different destinations in the cell."

Previous studies have shown that the bMERB domains in Micals can bind to their CH/LIM domains, forming an auto-inhibited intramolecular interaction that can be released by competitive binding of Rab proteins, thus allowing for the interaction with actin only after binding of Rabs (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sun et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sakane et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Schmidt et al., 2008</a>). The structural basis as well as the functional significance of this competitive binding will be an interesting topic for future research, especially regarding the binding region at the RBD responsible for auto-inhibition. The two binding sites might therefore also have separate functions, serving as a membrane recruitment site by Rabs via one site (presumably the high-affinity binding site) and release of the auto-inhibition due to competitive binding of the CH/LIM domains and Rabs at the second binding site."

The underlying single \u03b1-hairpin motifs making up the separate Rab-binding sites are known from other Rab-effectors such as Rabenosyn-5 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Khan and M\u00e9n\u00e9trey, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Eathiraj et al., 2005</a>), and the resulting fused \u03b1-hairpins observed in Micals and EHBPs strongly resemble the architecture of spectrin repeats, each being connected via one continuous helix (<a href=\"#bib14\">Han et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Pascual et al., 1997</a>). Because of the strong similarity between the repeats of the different isoforms of Micals and EHBPs, but less similarity between both repeats within the bMERB domains (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>), we suggest that the duplication must have occurred early in evolution in one common ancestor bMERB domain. The two repeats have since diverged in terms of overall sequence, but the ability to bind Rab proteins has remained in at least some cases, as shown in this study. Exploration of the binding specificity of both binding sites of the bMERB proteins towards Rabs (and possibly other GTPases [<a href=\"#bib38\">Rahajeng et al., 2012</a>]) will therefore be of great interest."
