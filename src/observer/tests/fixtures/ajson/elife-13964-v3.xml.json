Drugs targeting the Androgen Receptor (AR), a 'lineage driver' of PC (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib10\">Garraway and Sellers, 2006</xref>), are an important therapeutic approach. AR is an androgen (i.e. testosterone)-activated nuclear hormone receptor that regulates normal prostate gland growth and differentiation. In PC however, AR facilitates unregulated proliferation (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib19\">Mills, 2014</xref>). While it is unclear how AR and other lineage factors switch between promoting normal lineage differentiation vs. tumor growth, it is hypothesized that somatic mutations in additional genes may facilitate such changes (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib10\">Garraway and Sellers, 2006</xref>). Many PCs bear chromosomal translocations resulting in aberrant expression of the ETS transcription factor ERG, most commonly through the <italic>TMPRSS2:ERG</italic> fusion (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib22\">Shah and Chinnaiyan, 2009</xref>). <italic>TMPRSS2:ERG</italic>, alone or in combination with additional genetic alterations, promotes prostate tumor formation in mice (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib2\">Baena et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib6\">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib13\">King et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib14\">Klezovitch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib20\">Mounir et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib24\">Tomlins et al., 2008</xref>). ERG is recruited to many AR target genes and represses AR-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib30\">Yu et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting ERG functions at least in part through attenuating AR target gene expression. However, ERG also regulates the expression of AR-independent genes thought to drive oncogenic function (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib14\">Klezovitch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib20\">Mounir et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib24\">Tomlins et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib25\">Wang et al., 2008</xref>).

Identified proteins (<xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</xref>) included AR and DNA-PKcs, previously known ERG interactors (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib3\">Brenner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib30\">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). Eight of the VCaP-selective shRNA screen hits that also co-immunoprecipitated with ERG were further validated by directed ERG co-immunoprecipitation experiments in VCaP cells. Of these, AR and PRMT5 were the only proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with ERG but not IgG control; these interactions were not overtly influenced by exposure to an androgen analog (R1881, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</xref>). We next tested whether the ERG/PRMT5 interaction is observed in other models. PRMT5 co-immunoprecipitated with ERG in 22Rv1 cells ectopically expressing ERG. This interaction was still observed upon expression of ERG bearing mutations in the DNA binding domain ('Dx', <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting DNA binding is not required for the ERG/PRMT5 interaction. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments using overexpressed ERG and PRMT5 in AR-negative 293 and PC3 cells suggest the ERG/PRMT5 interaction can occur in the absence of AR (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We therefore hypothesized that PRMT5 directly methylates AR. To test this, we immunoprecipitated AR from ERG-positive VCaP cells, and blotted for AR, mono-methyl arginine (MMA), or symmetric di-methyl arginine (SDMA). MMA and SDMA signals were indeed detected in AR immunoprecipitates from VCaP cells, and were reduced following knockdown of either ERG or PRMT5 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3A</xref>). To confirm these findings in an additional ERG-dependent model, we also immunoprecipitated AR from the prostates of wild-type and <italic>TMPRSS2:ERG</italic> transgenic mice, the latter of which show ERG-dependent hyperproliferative phenotypes (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib20\">Mounir et al., 2015</xref>).

In these cells, ERG expression increased MMA and SDMA signals on wild-type AR but not the truncated variant, and these ERG-dependent signals were reduced upon PRMT5 knockdown (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting the AR LBD is mono- and symmetrically di-methylated in an ERG- and PRMT5-dependent manner."

PRMT5 activity, as judged by production of SAH (the by-product of SAM-dependent substrate methylation), was observed in the presence of AR LBD as substrate, but not in the presence of ERG ETS DNA binding domain or pointed (PNT) domain. PRMT5 activity in the presence of AR LBD further increased with the addition of ERG ETS domain protein to the reaction, but not with PNT domain (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</xref>).

PRMT5 dependent methylation of the AR-LBD was also observed in western blots, where increased signal for MMA (but not SDMA, likely due to low overall PRMT5 activity in vitro and the distributive nature of this enzyme [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib26\">Wang et al., 2014</xref>]) was observed at the correct size for the AR-LBD protein in the presence of PRMT5. This activity was increased by ERG ETS domain, and inhibited by AMI-1 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013D</xref>). Together this data indicates that AR LBD is a substrate of the PRMT5 enzyme in vitro, and that the ERG ETS domain can facilitate greater PRMT5 activity on AR."

These signals were not detected in the AR R761K mutant cell line (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3G</xref>).

Our results indicate that a primary effect of ERG in facilitating PC proliferation is modulating AR function. We propose that ERG- and PRMT5-dependent methylation of R761 on AR reduces AR recruitment to genes that would otherwise induce differentiation, yet R761 methylation allows sufficient AR function to promote proliferation. While our results raise the question of how R761-methylated AR may still facilitate proliferation, R761 methylation could prove a relevant biomarker for AR-mediated proliferation versus arrest in <italic>TMPRSS2:ERG</italic> positive cells. Finally, as PRMT5 is an enzyme required downstream of ERG in facilitating AR proliferative function, exploring therapeutic PRMT5 inhibition in <italic>TMPRSS2:ERG</italic> positive prostate cancers may be warranted."

To obtain an MOI of 0.3, the required volume of virus was determined using a 10 point dose curve ranging from 0 to 1ml of viral supernatant in the presence of 10\u00a0ug/ml polybrene. Infection efficiency was determined by the percentage of RFP positive cells measured by FACS analysis. Screens were run in duplicate. For the 22Rv1 screen, 14.4 million cells were plated 24\u2009hr prior to infection in T-225 flasks. On the day of infection, the culture media was replaced with fresh media containing 10\u00a0ug/mL polybrene and sufficient virus was added for an MOI of 0.3. 24\u2009hr after infection, the culture media was replaced with fresh media containing puromycin. 72\u2009hr following puromycin addition, cells were trypsinized, and 14.4 million cells were plated into new flasks. For the VCaP screen, 23.7 million cells were plated 24\u2009hr prior to infection in T-225 flasks. On the day of infection, the culture media was replaced with fresh media containing 10\u00a0ug/mL polybrene and sufficient virus was added for an MOI of 0.3. 24\u2009hr after infection, the culture media was replaced with fresh media and cells were allowed to recover for 72\u2009hr prior to puromycin selection. 5 days following puromycin addition, cells were trypsinized, and 23.7 million cells were plated into new flasks. At each passage, an aliquot of cells was used to measure transduction efficiency determined by measuring the% RFP positive cells and was typically > 90%. Cells were maintained in culture and split when confluence reached 90% and at each passage, 14.4 million cells (22Rv1 screen) and 23.7 million cells (VCaP screen) were passaged into new flasks, ensuring a representation of >1000 cells/shRNA in the library and the% RFP positive cells was measured to ensure stability of the transduced population over time. When the cells reached 5-population doublings, 40 million cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Purification of genomic DNA and PCR for library production were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib12\">Hoffman et al., 2014</xref>). shRNA screen data analysis was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib12\">Hoffman et al., 2014</xref>).

Briefly, the RSA down p-value is the statistical score that models the probability of a gene 'hit' based on the collective activities of multiple shRNAs per gene. The RSA down p-value reports the statistically significant genes causing a loss in viability. All hits showing an RSA score >10<sup>-5</sup> in the 22Rv1 screen and <10<sup>-5</sup> in the VCaP screen (total of 32 genes) were used for further analysis (see <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</xref> for full list)."

A superposition was achieved using secondary structure matching in COOT (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib9\">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>). The AR DBD was superposed onto chain A of RXR\u03b1 and the AR-LBD was superposed onto chain B of PPAR\u03b3, resulting in the final overlay shown in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4A</xref>. A dimethylated Arg was superposed onto R761 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_000035.2; some publications may refer to it as R760 when using the previous Reference Sequence number) within the AR LBD using least squares fit and matching only mainchain atoms, after which the non-methylated Arg was removed from the resulting model. While structure determination of AR containing its intact DBD and LBD has remained elusive, structural data of each individual domain, as well as intact structures within the nuclear receptor family, lead to a valuable understanding of interdomain communication. A previous study utilized the heterodimeric structure of PPAR\u03b3 and RXR\u03b1 to apply in silico three-dimensional alignment and docking analysis, followed by mutational analysis, to propose a DBD-LBD interface within AR, including R761 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib4\">Chandra V et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib11\">Helsen et al., 2012</xref>). We hypothesize that R761 is involved in key interactions at this interface and that its methylation would add hydrophobicity, eliminating any polar interactions, as well as steric bulk. This disruption at the DBD-LBD interface could result in destabilization of the quaternary structure, resulting in an inhibitory effect on AR activation. While AR R761K closely mimics the properties of wt AR, the substitution eliminates the possibility of methylation by PRMT5 and, therefore, eliminates the possibility of this type of disruption, accounting for the observed increase in activation."

This would be certainly relevant to the prostate field. In addition, it is appropriate for a general audience for implications of a general enzyme that affects specific programs. The experiments are well done and logical. The manuscript is well written. However, at this point, there are several critical experiments that should be performed to solidify the conclusion."

To address the general lack of <italic>TMPRSS2:ERG</italic> positive models, we have explored the ERG/PRMT5 interaction using additional model systems. First, in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2C</xref> we expressed exogenous ERG, or a DNA-binding defective mutant of ERG (DNA binding defective, or 'Dx', which is mutant for two key arginines that contact DNA), in AR-positive 22Rv1 prostate cells. This demonstrates that the ERG/PRMT5 interaction can be observed outside VCaP. Furthermore, PRMT5 shRNA in this line demonstrates that the band observed in IP experiments is indeed PRMT5, and further suggests that DNA binding is not required to observe this interaction. Second, in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</xref>, we perform reciprocal PRMT5 and ERG IP\u2019s in AR-negative 293 and PC3 cells, respectively. These data show that the ERG/PRMT5 interaction can occur in the absence of AR. Third, in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</xref>, we generated truncated mutants of ERG, and expressed these constructs in 293 cells. All of these constructs contain the ETS DNA binding domain, suggesting that this domain is required for PRMT5 interaction. Unfortunately, constructs deleted for the ETS DNA binding domain could not be expressed to further confirm this finding. Fourth, in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig3\">Figure 3B</xref>, we IP\u2019ed AR from prostate tissues of <italic>TMPRSS2:ERG</italic> transgenic mice vs. control mice (Mounir et al., Oncogene 2015); AR immunoprecipitates from the <italic>TMPRSS2:ERG</italic> mouse prostates show increased SDMA and MMA signals at the correct size for AR. Fifth, we show in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</xref> that the effects of PRMT5 knockdown are specific to ERG-dependent AR targets in VCaP, and that PRMT5 knockdown does not affect previously described AR-independent targets of ERG. Together, we feel this data strongly suggests the ERG/PRMT5 interaction, as well as increased AR arginine methylation in the presence of ERG, is present outside of the VCaP model, and that the ability of PRMT5 to mediate ERG activity is specific to AR-dependent genes."

In the absence of an AR-R761me2s-specific antibody for immunoblotting or IHC, we planned to use a chromogenic in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) (Duolink In Situ \u2013 Brightfield, Sigma \u2013 Aldrich) with primary antibodies recognizing AR and symmetric di-methyl arginine (SDMA) to detect AR-R761me2s in human prostate cancer samples. First, we focused on optimizing PLA for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, using FFPE RWPE-1 prostate cells, FFPE human prostate cancer samples, and two primary antibodies against Ki67 (Ki67 mouse monoclonal antibody, Dako; and Ki67 rabbit monoclonal antibody, Vector). While numerous individual spots representing positive signal were detected in the nuclei of RWPE-1 prostate cells, few, if any, spots were seen in the human tissues (see <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Author response image 1</xref>), suggesting that pre-analytic variables, such as formalin-fixation time and storage conditions, may be have decreased the sensitivity of PLA to a point where the positive signal is below the limit of detection of the assay. Therefore, unfortunately, we do not currently have a robust means of detecting AR-R761me2s in human prostate cancer samples. The generation of a specific AR-R761me2s antibody would be of great benefit; however, we have not yet been able to generate such reagents.",
