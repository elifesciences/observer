                    "text": "The <i>TMPRSS2:ERG</i> gene fusion is common in androgen receptor (AR) positive prostate cancers, yet its function remains poorly understood. From a screen for functionally relevant ERG interactors, we identify the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5. ERG recruits PRMT5 to AR-target genes, where PRMT5 methylates AR on arginine 761. This attenuates AR recruitment and transcription of genes expressed in differentiated prostate epithelium. The AR-inhibitory function of PRMT5 is restricted to <i>TMPRSS2:ERG</i>-positive prostate cancer cells. Mutation of this methylation site on AR results in a transcriptionally hyperactive AR, suggesting that the proliferative effects of ERG and PRMT5 are mediated through attenuating AR\u2019s ability to induce genes normally involved in lineage differentiation. This provides a rationale for targeting PRMT5 in <i>TMPRSS2:ERG</i> positive prostate cancers. Moreover, methylation of AR at arginine 761 highlights a mechanism for how the ERG oncogene may coax AR towards inducing proliferation versus differentiation."

From a screen for functionally relevant ERG interactors, we identify the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5. ERG recruits PRMT5 to AR-target genes, where PRMT5 methylates AR on arginine 761. This attenuates AR recruitment and transcription of genes expressed in differentiated prostate epithelium. The AR-inhibitory function of PRMT5 is restricted to <i>TMPRSS2:ERG</i>-positive prostate cancer cells. Mutation of this methylation site on AR results in a transcriptionally hyperactive AR, suggesting that the proliferative effects of ERG and PRMT5 are mediated through attenuating AR\u2019s ability to induce genes normally involved in lineage differentiation. This provides a rationale for targeting PRMT5 in <i>TMPRSS2:ERG</i> positive prostate cancers. Moreover, methylation of AR at arginine 761 highlights a mechanism for how the ERG oncogene may coax AR towards inducing proliferation versus differentiation."

Drugs targeting the Androgen Receptor (AR), a 'lineage driver' of PC (<a href=\"#bib10\">Garraway and Sellers, 2006</a>), are an important therapeutic approach. AR is an androgen (i.e. testosterone)-activated nuclear hormone receptor that regulates normal prostate gland growth and differentiation. In PC however, AR facilitates unregulated proliferation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mills, 2014</a>). While it is unclear how AR and other lineage factors switch between promoting normal lineage differentiation vs. tumor growth, it is hypothesized that somatic mutations in additional genes may facilitate such changes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Garraway and Sellers, 2006</a>). Many PCs bear chromosomal translocations resulting in aberrant expression of the ETS transcription factor ERG, most commonly through the <i>TMPRSS2:ERG</i> fusion (<a href=\"#bib22\">Shah and Chinnaiyan, 2009</a>). <i>TMPRSS2:ERG</i>, alone or in combination with additional genetic alterations, promotes prostate tumor formation in mice (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baena et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">King et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Klezovitch et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Mounir et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Tomlins et al., 2008</a>). ERG is recruited to many AR target genes and represses AR-dependent transcription (<a href=\"#bib30\">Yu et al., 2010</a>), suggesting ERG functions at least in part through attenuating AR target gene expression. However, ERG also regulates the expression of AR-independent genes thought to drive oncogenic function (<a href=\"#bib14\">Klezovitch et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Mounir et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Tomlins et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Wang et al., 2008</a>). We explored whether a deeper mechanistic understanding of ERG proliferative function could yield therapeutic insights into targeting this key PC oncogene."

We immunoprecipitated ERG from VCaP cells, and then identified co-immunoprecipitated proteins by mass spectrometry (Materials and methods). Identified proteins (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>) included AR and DNA-PKcs, previously known ERG interactors (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brenner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Yu et al., 2010</a>). Eight of the VCaP-selective shRNA screen hits that also co-immunoprecipitated with ERG were further validated by directed ERG co-immunoprecipitation experiments in VCaP cells. Of these, AR and PRMT5 were the only proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with ERG but not IgG control; these interactions were not overtly influenced by exposure to an androgen analog (R1881, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We next tested whether the ERG/PRMT5 interaction is observed in other models. PRMT5 co-immunoprecipitated with ERG in 22Rv1 cells ectopically expressing ERG. This interaction was still observed upon expression of ERG bearing mutations in the DNA binding domain ('Dx', <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), suggesting DNA binding is not required for the ERG/PRMT5 interaction. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments using overexpressed ERG and PRMT5 in AR-negative 293 and PC3 cells suggest the ERG/PRMT5 interaction can occur in the absence of AR (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Further work in 293 cells using truncated ERG constructs suggested that the conserved ETS DNA binding domain of ERG was necessary for the observed co-immunoprecipitation with PRMT5 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

PRMT5 knockdown was robust in all cell lines (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Robust growth inhibition was observed in VCaP cells; in contrast PRMT5 knockdown had no growth effects in ERG-negative 22Rv1 cells, and only minor effects in ERG negative LNCaP cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>). Deletion of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), which is common across cancers, is a major determinant of sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibition (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kryukov et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Mavrakis et al., 2016</a>); as VCaP, LNCaP, and 22Rv1 cells are all MTAP intact, the observed sensitivity of VCaP to PRMT5 shRNA is not due to MTAP deletion.

Among these, AR activation was the second most significantly affected pathway, and is a key pathway in common with previous reports of ERG knockdown in VCaP cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Mounir et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Yu et al., 2010</a>).

ERG knockdown in VCaP reduced its recruitment to previously characterized (<a href=\"#bib27\">Wei et al., 2010</a>) binding sites on both genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We also observed PRMT5 recruitment to these same sites, which was dramatically reduced upon ERG knockdown. Conversely, ERG expression in 22Rv1 cells induced PRMT5 recruitment to these same sites (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). In VCaP, PRMT5 knockdown reduced its own recruitment to both genes but had virtually no effect on ERG recruitment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

ERG and AR recruitment were robust in these experiments, as judged by recovery of the canonical DNA binding sites of these proteins (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2013D</a>). In agreement with directed ChIP experiments, AR ChIP-seq demonstrated that PRMT5 knockdown increased the recruitment of AR at a subset of peaks (6% p-val 0.01, q-val 0.151), (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), but did not significantly affect ERG binding on the same set of sites.

However, ERG expression in 22Rv1 cells did not alter H4R3me2s levels at the <i>PSA</i> or <i>NKX3-1</i> loci (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We therefore hypothesized that PRMT5 directly methylates AR. To test this, we immunoprecipitated AR from ERG-positive VCaP cells, and blotted for AR, mono-methyl arginine (MMA), or symmetric di-methyl arginine (SDMA). MMA and SDMA signals were indeed detected in AR immunoprecipitates from VCaP cells, and were reduced following knockdown of either ERG or PRMT5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To confirm these findings in an additional ERG-dependent model, we also immunoprecipitated AR from the prostates of wild-type and <i>TMPRSS2:ERG</i> transgenic mice, the latter of which show ERG-dependent hyperproliferative phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mounir et al., 2015</a>). Like VCaP, immunoprecipitated AR from <i>TMPRSS2:ERG</i> mouse prostates showed high mono- (MMA) and symmetric di-methylation (SDMA) levels compared to wild-type controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). On the other hand, LNCaP cells, which bear a translocation in the ETS factor <i>ETV1</i>, do not show any SDMA signal on AR, and show reduced levels of MMA versus VCaP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), suggesting that AR symmetric dimethylation is unique to ERG versus ETV1. We next immunoprecipitated AR from 22Rv1 cells, which express wild-type AR as well as a roughly 80\u2009kDa truncated AR variant that lacks its ligand binding domain (LBD) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dehm et al., 2008</a>). In these cells, ERG expression increased MMA and SDMA signals on wild-type AR but not the truncated variant, and these ERG-dependent signals were reduced upon PRMT5 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), suggesting the AR LBD is mono- and symmetrically di-methylated in an ERG- and PRMT5-dependent manner."

PRMT5 activity, as judged by production of SAH (the by-product of SAM-dependent substrate methylation), was observed in the presence of AR LBD as substrate, but not in the presence of ERG ETS DNA binding domain or pointed (PNT) domain. PRMT5 activity in the presence of AR LBD further increased with the addition of ERG ETS domain protein to the reaction, but not with PNT domain (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Unlike PRMT5, purified PRMT1 showed no activity in the presence of AR LBD (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). PRMT5 activity on AR, in the absence or presence of ERG ETS domain, was reduced with the addition of the tool PRMT inhibitor AMI-1 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng et al., 2004</a>). PRMT5 dependent methylation of the AR-LBD was also observed in western blots, where increased signal for MMA (but not SDMA, likely due to low overall PRMT5 activity in vitro and the distributive nature of this enzyme [<a href=\"#bib26\">Wang et al., 2014</a>]) was observed at the correct size for the AR-LBD protein in the presence of PRMT5. This activity was increased by ERG ETS domain, and inhibited by AMI-1 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013D</a>). Together this data indicates that AR LBD is a substrate of the PRMT5 enzyme in vitro, and that the ERG ETS domain can facilitate greater PRMT5 activity on AR."

ERG expression represses this effect (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013B</a>) and induces PRMT5-dependent mono- and symmetric di-methylation of AR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). RWPE-1 cells co-expressing ERG with each of the AR constructs were assessed for SDMA and MMA modification of AR following immunoprecipitation. All mutants were expressed at equivalent levels to wild-type AR (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). Only one AR mutant, R761K, completely lacked MMA and SDMA of AR in the presence of ERG (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>). We confirmed these results in RWPE-1 cells using a proximity ligation assay to detect symmetric di-methylation of AR (Materials and methods). We detected strong proximity signals in RWPE-1 nuclei upon expression of wild-type AR and exposure to R1881 (which stimulates nuclear translocation of AR) that were dependent upon ERG expression. These signals were not detected in the AR R761K mutant cell line (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). This demonstrates that arginine 761 is the likely target of ERG- and PRMT5-dependent AR methylation."

To test this, we evaluated the recruitment of WT versus R761K mutant AR in RWPE-1 cells treated with R1881, using the <i>PSA</i> locus as a model AR-regulated gene. Relative to WT AR, the AR R761K mutant showed enhanced recruitment to <i>PSA</i> and increased <i>PSA</i> expression. Moreover, R761K mutation prevented ERG-dependent attenuation of AR recruitment to <i>PSA</i> and <i>PSA</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). In contrast to these effects, the AR R761K mutation did not affect overall AR protein levels, the ability of AR to shuttle into the nucleus upon R1881 induction (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), or the levels of ERG or PRMT5 recruitment to <i>PSA</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Our results indicate that a primary effect of ERG in facilitating PC proliferation is modulating AR function. We propose that ERG- and PRMT5-dependent methylation of R761 on AR reduces AR recruitment to genes that would otherwise induce differentiation, yet R761 methylation allows sufficient AR function to promote proliferation. While our results raise the question of how R761-methylated AR may still facilitate proliferation, R761 methylation could prove a relevant biomarker for AR-mediated proliferation versus arrest in <i>TMPRSS2:ERG</i> positive cells. Finally, as PRMT5 is an enzyme required downstream of ERG in facilitating AR proliferative function, exploring therapeutic PRMT5 inhibition in <i>TMPRSS2:ERG</i> positive prostate cancers may be warranted."

A superposition was achieved using secondary structure matching in COOT (<a href=\"#bib9\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>). The AR DBD was superposed onto chain A of RXR\u03b1 and the AR-LBD was superposed onto chain B of PPAR\u03b3, resulting in the final overlay shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>. A dimethylated Arg was superposed onto R761 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_000035.2; some publications may refer to it as R760 when using the previous Reference Sequence number) within the AR LBD using least squares fit and matching only mainchain atoms, after which the non-methylated Arg was removed from the resulting model. While structure determination of AR containing its intact DBD and LBD has remained elusive, structural data of each individual domain, as well as intact structures within the nuclear receptor family, lead to a valuable understanding of interdomain communication. A previous study utilized the heterodimeric structure of PPAR\u03b3 and RXR\u03b1 to apply in silico three-dimensional alignment and docking analysis, followed by mutational analysis, to propose a DBD-LBD interface within AR, including R761 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chandra V et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Helsen et al., 2012</a>). We hypothesize that R761 is involved in key interactions at this interface and that its methylation would add hydrophobicity, eliminating any polar interactions, as well as steric bulk. This disruption at the DBD-LBD interface could result in destabilization of the quaternary structure, resulting in an inhibitory effect on AR activation. While AR R761K closely mimics the properties of wt AR, the substitution eliminates the possibility of methylation by PRMT5 and, therefore, eliminates the possibility of this type of disruption, accounting for the observed increase in activation."

Overall, the findings address long-standing questions of ERG function in prostate tumorigenesis and possibly posit new therapies to ERG translocated prostate cancers. This would be certainly relevant to the prostate field. In addition, it is appropriate for a general audience for implications of a general enzyme that affects specific programs. The experiments are well done and logical. The manuscript is well written. However, at this point, there are several critical experiments that should be performed to solidify the conclusion."

In agreement with our data from directed analyses of the AR targets <i>KLK3</i> (aka <i>PSA</i>) and <i>NKX3-1</i>, the ChIPseq dataset shows a significant increase of AR recruitment upon PRMT5 knockdown at 6% of the total AR-bound cistrome. Genome-wide recruitment of ERG was not significantly affected upon PRMT5 knockdown, including to the sites where AR recruitment was increased (this data is deposited in NCBI, but no figures added to the paper due to the lack of significant findings). This data agrees with our model that ERG recruits PRMT5 to attenuate AR activity to a significant subset of its target genes."

To address the general lack of <i>TMPRSS2:ERG</i> positive models, we have explored the ERG/PRMT5 interaction using additional model systems. First, in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> we expressed exogenous ERG, or a DNA-binding defective mutant of ERG (DNA binding defective, or 'Dx', which is mutant for two key arginines that contact DNA), in AR-positive 22Rv1 prostate cells. This demonstrates that the ERG/PRMT5 interaction can be observed outside VCaP. Furthermore, PRMT5 shRNA in this line demonstrates that the band observed in IP experiments is indeed PRMT5, and further suggests that DNA binding is not required to observe this interaction. Second, in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, we perform reciprocal PRMT5 and ERG IP\u2019s in AR-negative 293 and PC3 cells, respectively. These data show that the ERG/PRMT5 interaction can occur in the absence of AR. Third, in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, we generated truncated mutants of ERG, and expressed these constructs in 293 cells. All of these constructs contain the ETS DNA binding domain, suggesting that this domain is required for PRMT5 interaction. Unfortunately, constructs deleted for the ETS DNA binding domain could not be expressed to further confirm this finding. Fourth, in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, we IP\u2019ed AR from prostate tissues of <i>TMPRSS2:ERG</i> transgenic mice vs. control mice (Mounir et al., Oncogene 2015); AR immunoprecipitates from the <i>TMPRSS2:ERG</i> mouse prostates show increased SDMA and MMA signals at the correct size for AR. Fifth, we show in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a> that the effects of PRMT5 knockdown are specific to ERG-dependent AR targets in VCaP, and that PRMT5 knockdown does not affect previously described AR-independent targets of ERG. Together, we feel this data strongly suggests the ERG/PRMT5 interaction, as well as increased AR arginine methylation in the presence of ERG, is present outside of the VCaP model, and that the ability of PRMT5 to mediate ERG activity is specific to AR-dependent genes."

In the absence of an AR-R761me2s-specific antibody for immunoblotting or IHC, we planned to use a chromogenic in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) (Duolink In Situ \u2013 Brightfield, Sigma \u2013 Aldrich) with primary antibodies recognizing AR and symmetric di-methyl arginine (SDMA) to detect AR-R761me2s in human prostate cancer samples. First, we focused on optimizing PLA for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, using FFPE RWPE-1 prostate cells, FFPE human prostate cancer samples, and two primary antibodies against Ki67 (Ki67 mouse monoclonal antibody, Dako; and Ki67 rabbit monoclonal antibody, Vector). While numerous individual spots representing positive signal were detected in the nuclei of RWPE-1 prostate cells, few, if any, spots were seen in the human tissues (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Author response image 1</a>), suggesting that pre-analytic variables, such as formalin-fixation time and storage conditions, may be have decreased the sensitivity of PLA to a point where the positive signal is below the limit of detection of the assay. Therefore, unfortunately, we do not currently have a robust means of detecting AR-R761me2s in human prostate cancer samples. The generation of a specific AR-R761me2s antibody would be of great benefit; however, we have not yet been able to generate such reagents."

In our hands, arginine methylation has been generally difficult to detect, including on histones, which are 'classic' PRMT5 targets. We suspect that R761me2s does not occur on the entire population of AR within the cell lysate, which 'masks' the detection of methylated AR by mass spec. This may be in line with the observation that PRMT5 knockdown does not affect AR recruitment to all possible sites in our ChIPseq experiments."
