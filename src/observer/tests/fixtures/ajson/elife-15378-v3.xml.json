Participants learned to adapt reaching movements to two conflicting dynamical environments that were each associated with a different tDCS polarity (anodal or cathodal tDCS) on the sensorimotor cortex. That is, we sought to determine whether divergent background activity levels within the sensorimotor cortex (anodal: higher activity; cathodal: lower activity) give rise to distinct motor memories. After a training session, application of each tDCS polarity automatically resulted in the retrieval of the motor memory corresponding to that polarity. These results reveal that artificial modulation of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex through tDCS can act as a context for the formation and recollection of motor memories."

Participants learned to adapt reaching movements to two conflicting dynamical environments that were each associated with a different tDCS polarity (anodal or cathodal tDCS) on the sensorimotor cortex. That is, we sought to determine whether divergent background activity levels within the sensorimotor cortex (anodal: higher activity; cathodal: lower activity) give rise to distinct motor memories. After a training session, application of each tDCS polarity automatically resulted in the retrieval of the motor memory corresponding to that polarity. These results reveal that artificial modulation of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex through tDCS can act as a context for the formation and recollection of motor memories."

Sometimes the robot pushed the participant\u2019s hand to the left, and sometimes to the right.

Artificially generating a different pattern of background brain electrical activity for each push direction caused the motor memories associated with leftward and rightward pushes to be tagged differently. Once this association had been learnt, applying the artificial brain stimulation pattern associated with one of the pushes resulted in the participants unconsciously compensating for a push in that direction, even when it was not there."

Further experiments are also needed to test whether the same approach can influence the formation and recollection of other kinds of memories, such as those related to fear."

Although previous studies have examined whether context-dependency also exists in <i>motor</i> memory, context-dependent motor learning based on contextual cues has proven quite difficult. For example, participants have difficulty adapting identical reaching movements to conflicting dynamical environments (e.g., velocity-dependent rightward and leftward force fields) according to a contextual cue (e.g., room color, target color, etc [<a href=\"#bib14\">Gandolfo et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Osu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nozaki et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hirashima and Nozaki, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kadota et al., 2014</a>])."

However, the underlying mechanisms regarding context-dependent motor learning and memory are largely unknown. Notably, contexts that are shown to be useful are often associated with different neural activity patterns of the sensorimotor cortex including the primary motor cortex (M1) and the premotor cortex (PM). For example, distinct motor memories for identical reaching movements can be created depending on whether the opposite arm is stationary or moving (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nozaki et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kadota et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nozaki and Scott, 2009</a>). Consistent with this finding, it has been reported that opposite arm movements alter M1 and PM activity during reaching movements (<a href=\"#bib10\">Donchin et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cisek et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ganguly et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rokni et al., 2003</a>). In agreement with the significant role of these brain areas in motor learning (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kadota et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gandolfo et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Muellbacher et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Arce et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Orban de Xivry et al., 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib42\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">2013</a>), we hypothesized that, when a motor memory is formed under different activity patterns in the sensorimotor cortex associated with different contexts, a motor memory specific to this particular activity pattern is created. As a result, later reinstating this activity pattern in these areas should lead to automatic retrieval of the corresponding memory."

                        "text": "Here, we tested this hypothesis directly using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">Nitsche et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Orban de Xivry and Shadmehr, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Di Lazzaro and Rothwell, 2014</a>). tDCS to the sensorimotor cortex modulates spontaneous M1 activity and excitability according to its polarity. As a result, the size of the motor evoked potential induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation is increased or decreased by, respectively, anodal or cathodal tDCS during (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nitsche et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">2007</a>) and even after the application of stimulation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nitsche and Paulus, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Siebner et al., 2004</a>). This suggests that different brain activity patterns (i.e. specific to the polarity of the stimulation) could be artificially created by tDCS. We predicted that motor learning performed under different background activity patterns of the sensorimotor cortex created by tDCS would yield to the formation of separate motor memories. Participants were trained to perform reaching movements in the presence of two conflicting force fields while receiving tDCS on the sensorimotor cortex. Critically, training for each force field was always associated with a distinct tDCS polarity. We then examined if, after training, applying a particular tDCS polarity reactivated the motor memory associated with this polarity, despite no explicit contextual change."

In contrast, if the stimulation polarity influences the force output during the test period, the residuals should be more positive (above the exponential curve) during cathodal stimulation and more negative (below the exponential curve) during anodal stimulation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). Given that the two subgroups received different polarity during each of the blocks, the polarity-dependent change in residuals was opposite between the two groups (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). That is, the residuals were always more positive for the group receiving cathodal stimulation during one of the blocks and more negative for the group receiving anodal stimulation during the same block (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). The modulation of the force output by tDCS was analyzed with a 3-way ANOVA with subgroup as a between-subject factor and period (first or second half of the test period, 2 blocks each) and block-order (first and\u00a0second block of each half of the test period) as a within-subject factors (See <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for the definitions of period and block order).

We compute the probability that there was an effect of stimulation polarity on force during the test period when the effect is observed in 3 out of the 4 groups. To compute this, we used a rationale provided by <a href=\"#bib25\">Ioannidis (2005)</a> but adapted this justification to our positive results, as was done by <a href=\"#bib28\">Lakens and Evers (2014)</a>. Given a power of 0.8, the probability of observing three significant and one non-significant finding if there is a true effect is as follows (Type 2 error): 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 0.2 = 0.1024. Any of the four groups could yield a non-significant finding, so the a-priori likelihood of finding three out of four significant effects is 0.4096. We also needed to find the probability of observing these results if there was no effect (null hypothesis is true). Given a Type 1 error of 0.05 (significance threshold), this probability is as follows: p\u00a0=\u00a00.05 \u00d7 0.05 \u00d7 0.05 \u00d7 0.95 = 0.00011875. Again, because any group could be non-significant, the probability of finding these results if there is no effect is p\u00a0=\u00a00.000475. With these data, we can compute the positive predictive value (PPV)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib25\">Ioannidis, 2005</a>). This number represents the post-study probability that the effect is true: PPV = 0.4096/(0.4096 + 0.000475) = 0.998. That is, the likelihood that there is a true effect despite the fact that one of the four groups yielded a non-significant effect is 99.8%."

While we detected a main effect of block order on the \u0394Force permutation test: p\u00a0=\u00a00.0263), this effect was reduced over time (permutation test: interaction between period and block order: p\u00a0=\u00a00.025) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e,f</a>).

We also compared the strength of modulation by subtracting the \u0394Force of S-T group from \u0394Force of T-T group (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). Although we did not find the expected interaction between group and block order (p\u00a0=\u00a00.205), this appeared to change over time (permutation test: interaction between block order, period and group: p\u00a0=\u00a00.0595).

Namely, cathodal stimulation makes motor memories last longer than anodal tDCS. Alternatively, the observed effect could reflect the possibility that the motor memory was tagged with the brain activity without tDCS and the application of different tDCS polarities during the test period might differently recruit the motor memories.

With this measure, higher interference is associated with higher lateral deviation on the first trial. When comparing this measure between the T-T, S-T, and T-S groups, we did not detect any significant differences in lateral deviation during the first trial [repeated measures 3-way ANOVA: F(2,45) = 2.369, p\u00a0=\u00a00.105, <math id=\"inf29\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03b7</mi><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msubsup></mrow></mstyle></math> = 0.088] (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>).

Although this type of learning enables us to perform flexible actions for adapting to a wide variety of dynamical environments (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yokoi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">2014</a>), it remains unknown how different behaviors result in the formation of distinct motor memories."

It should be noted that previous studies have also suggested that movement adaptation to a novel dynamical environment is accomplished through neural activity changes in these motor-related areas (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kadota et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gandolfo et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Arce et al., 2010</a>). Thus, it is natural to speculate that these neurons change their activation patterns during motor adaptation, depending on how they are originally recruited within the behavioral context. For example, distinct motor memories for unimanual and bimanual movements (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nozaki et al., 2006</a>) can be explained by considering that partially different populations of M1 and PM neurons are involved for motor adaptation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nozaki and Scott, 2009</a>)."

We examined this hypothesis by artificially creating two different background activity patterns in the sensorimotor cortex, using anodal and cathodal tDCS, when participants learned to perform reaching movements within 2 conflicting forcefields. Most importantly, each tDCS polarity was always associated with one of two force-fields. Consistent with this hypothesis, our experiments demonstrated that, after training, force output during the test period was modulated by the corresponding polarity (T-T group; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a\u2013c</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). In contrast, force output modulation was not observed when tDCS was applied to the PPC (PPC group; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Furthermore, the ability of tDCS to modulate force output, depending on polarity through mere changes in cortical excitability\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib48\">Salimpour and Shadmehr, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tanaka et al., 2009</a>), was insufficient to explain our observed force output modulation (S-T group; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d\u2013f</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a,b</a>)."

Taken together, our experiments strongly indicate that differential background activity patterns in the sensorimotor cortex, artificially created when a motor learning task is performed, could lead to the formation of distinct motor memories. These memories could then be artificially retrieved by applying the same-polarity tDCS during a reaching movement."

Furthermore, if tDCS can artificially induce motor memory recollection, tDCS may also artificially maintain motor memories when tested in different contexts. Indeed, we have previously shown that reaching movement adaptation to a force-field, while receiving anodal or cathodal tDCS, is more strongly generalized to reaching movements toward another direction performed with different arm postures (<a href=\"#bib43\">Orban de Xivry et al., 2011</a>). This improved generalization could be explained by the artificial maintenance of activity patterns in the sensorimotor cortex with tDCS when transitioning from the adaptation phase to the generalization phase."

Recent studies using fMRI (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lindenberg et al., 2013</a>) and electrical fields models (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gillick et al., 2014</a>) have indicated that bihemispheric tDCS effects are more localized than when using a conventional stimulation montage (i.e., placing one electrode on the forehead), but we cannot reject the possibility that broader brain areas are also involved. Given our bilateral stimulation, it is also\u00a0possible that stimulation to the ipsilateral right sensorimotor cortex (ipsilateral to the moving arm) caused the observed effects (rather than the contralateral left sensorimotor cortex). Further studies using a High-Defintion tDCS (<a href=\"#bib8\">Datta et al., 2009</a>) will be necessary to clarify these issues. Finally, however, given that tDCS had no effect on memory retrieval when applied on the PPC, the involvement of the underlying parietal areas, including sensory areas, is unlikely or relatively small."

Although the present study only focused on the immediate modulating effect of tDCS on neural activity, tDCS also has long-lasting or plastic effects on the cortex (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nitsche et al., 2008</a>), raising questions as to whether activity patterns in the sensorimotor cortex were similar during the training and testing periods. For example, M1 excitability remains elevated, even after anodal tDCS termination, when stimulus duration is sufficiently long (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nitsche et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Nitsche and Paulus, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">2001</a>). However, we considered that any long-lasting effects did not play a dominant role in our results. First, as tDCS polarity switched every 2 min, durations were too short to induce long-lasting effects on cortical excitability. Second, as anodal and cathodal tDCS alternated, any long-lasting effects, including homeostatic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib54\">Siebner et al., 2004</a>), were likely cancelled out."

For example, invasive electrical stimulation to a particular region of the temporal cortex among patients with epilepsy can induce declarative memory recollection. This is perhaps due to reproducing an activity pattern similar to what was observed during voluntary recollection of that same memory (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jacobs et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, we used tDCS to reinstate an activity pattern in the sensorimotor cortex during learning in order to induce implicit retrieval of a particular motor memory. These effects are also similar to optogenetics\u2019 ability to manipulate a fear memory in mice by directly altering hippocampal neural activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ramirez et al., 2013</a>)."

This manipulation sheds light on the possibility that manipulating the formation and recollection of various memories, including declarative and other types of motor memories (e.g., visuomotor rotation task or sequence learning), can be achieved by artificially changing activity patterns of the corresponding brain region during the learning period. Thus, our novel tDCS application opens up new avenues for implementing tDCS in human memory research."

Two rubber electrodes (5 cm \u00d7 7 cm) covered with a sponge soaked in normal saline solution were placed symmetrically at the left and right M1 regions (around C3 and C4; T-T, S-T, T-S, and T<sup>ffrev</sup>-T groups) or at the left and right PPC regions (around P3 and P4; PPC group). We adopted the bihemispheric montage because the stimulated area can be more localized in the sensorimotor cortex, including M1\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib30\">Lindenberg et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gillick et al., 2014</a>). Before applying the electrical current, we carefully checked that resistance between the electrodes was below 5.0 k\u03a9, via an LCR meter (LCR821, GW Instek, Taiwan), in order to reduce pain or burn injury risk. The values before and after data collection were 3.86 \u00b1 1.09 and 3.38 \u00b1 2.07 k\u03a9, respectively. During the experiment, the electrical current was continuously monitored using an ammeter (Digital Multimeter CD772, Sanwa, Japan). Participants reported the degree of pain using a numerical rating scale (1<b>\u2013</b>10, 10 indicates maximal pain) after a 3-min break (i.e., after 8 blocks of training were completed) and after the experiment. The reported value was 2.19 \u00b1 1.06 and 2.25 \u00b1 1.08 for the T-T group (mean \u00b1 SD for the first 8 blocks and second 8 blocks, respectively), 2.63 \u00b1 1.38 and 3.23 \u00b1 1.43 for the S-T group, and 2.53 \u00b1 1.29 and 2.07 \u00b1 0.81 for the T-S group. It should be noted that participants experienced 4 blocks of sham tDCS in the first 8 blocks for the S-T group and in the second 8 blocks for the T-S group. There was a significant interaction in terms of reported pain between groups and block (i.e., first and second\u00a0block) [F(2,44) = 6.876, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003]. Thus, although the difference in scale values was less than 1, participants might feel stronger skin sensations for active tDCS than for sham tDCS."

The test period consisted of two repetitions of anodal-cathodal tDCS (ACAC subgroup) or cathodal-anodal tDCS (CACA subgroup). To test the effect of subgroup and stimulation polarity on the residuals of the force output during the test period, a repeated measures 3-way ANOVA was conducted with within-subject factors period (the first 2 blocks or last 2 blocks of the test period) and block order (the first or second block for each half of the test period, during which the same tDCS polarity was received in both halves of the test period) and between-subject factor subgroup (ACAC or CACA) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In this ANOVA, the factor block order can be assimilated with stimulation-induced polarity-dependent changes in force output. Indeed, tDCS polarity was identical between the first and third blocks of the test period (where the block order factor has the same value) and different during the second and fourth blocks of the test period (where the block order factor had another value). Given that the association between block and polarity was opposite between subgroups [the first (or second) block for the ACAC subgroup corresponded to anodal (or cathodal) stimulation and vice versa for the CACA subgroup], we expected, if tDCS influenced the force output, a significant interaction between subgroup and block order. In addition, if the force output varies with tDCS polarity in each subgroup, we expect a main effect of block order for each subgroup separately. The same analysis was used for hand velocity during the test period. We used a 4-way ANOVA where the between-subject factor group was added to contrast the effect of active and sham stimulation (T-T vs S-T or T-T vs T-S) and to contrast the effect of stimulation site (T-T vs PPC)."

While early results emphasized how sensorimotor adaptation was relatively impervious to context (e.g., color cues), recent work has identified a number of conditions in which contextual cues can be quite powerful. The current study takes the question of context in an entirely new direction, at least within the world of human motor learning, asking if modulation of the (endogenous) neural state can serve as a sufficient contextual cue. To this end, the authors use tDCS to establish the context, associating a force field in one direction with anodal tDCS and a force field in the opposite direction with cathodal tDCS. Of special note here is that the participants are completely unaware of the \"cue\", something that is not (usually) possible in studies involving behavioral manipulations of context."

While our requests for revision are relatively modest, there is one major, indeed critical, issue that needs to be addressed. While the leftward and rightward force fields induce significant changes in performance, the context effect is relatively small (estimate of about 5% of the force difference). In itself, this is not a concern if the effect is robust-that the authors see any effect here is impressive. However, the key analysis seems overly complex with a lot of parameters. The authors fit a 5-parameter function to every noisy individual-subject test-period data set, the result of which is there are over 400 free parameters (5params/subject x [48 subjects in the main experiments + 36 subjects in the controls], or about 80 in each experiment) to \"model\" the decay curves in the data. The residuals of these models serve as the primary \"data\" for the main analysis. With this analysis, one would want to see some graphic depiction of the parameters of the individual double-exponential fit. But, as noted below, we believe there is a better solution."

Our technique is guided by the fact that simple decay of motor memories should follow an exponential function (single or double) and that any deviation from such exponential should be due to the modulation of the force pattern by the polarity of the simulation. Therefore, we believe that calculating the residual by fitting the data with 2 exponential curves did not cause artificial stimulation-dependent modulation of the force but allowed us to eliminate the decaying component and slowly changing force output trends. Indeed, as shown in the figure below, the presence of force output modulation was not affected, even when fitting the data with a single exponential curve (see figure below and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> in the paper). The use of a double exponential curve function reduced the magnitude of the residuals, because it contributes to eliminate the slow drift in force with the data. Nevertheless, independently of the use of a single or double exponential function, we observed significant polarity-dependent modulation of the residuals, indicating strong evidence for the presence of this effect. The analysis of the residuals appears to us simpler than the bootstrap analysis suggested by the reviewers. In addition, it allows us to test for the existence of polarity-dependent changes in force output for each subgroup separately. Therefore, we took extra care in explaining this analysis into details and in describing the expected polarity-dependent changes in the residuals (third paragraph of the Results section, and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

According to the reviewers\u2019 suggestion, we performed a model-free analysis of the force patterns during the test period. It should be noted that, as \u2206Force was calculated from data recorded on different experimental groups, a bootstrap method was necessary to use the \u2206Force for statistical testing. Therefore, rather than simplifying the analysis, the model-free approach makes it more complicated. Specifically, we created bootstrap samples of \u2206Force (subtracting the CACA data from ACAC data for the T-T, S-T, and T-S groups) to obtain a mean and standard deviation of the resampled data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A, B, and C</a> in the revised manuscript). We also created bootstrap samples for block-wise changes between 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> blocks, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> blocks, and 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> blocks for the T-T, S-T, and T-S groups. Then, we tested the null hypothesis that there were no block-wise changes for the T-T, S-T or T-S groups (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B, D, and F</a>). Additionally, we applied the same bootstrap method to test if block-wise modulation was greater for the T-T than for the S-T or T-S groups."

Third, using the S-T group decay pattern as a baseline for the T-T group was not appropriate because each group received a different training protocol, which could influence the decay pattern (e.g., time constant). We believe the subtraction of the ACAC subgroup data from the CACA subgroup data (i.e., \u2206Force) was more appropriate to eliminate the effect of natural decay because they received the same training protocol.

We also created a plot for the T-T and T-S groups (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C, D</a>), and for the T-T and PPC groups (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E, F</a>). These new plots clearly indicate the presence of different modulation patterns between the T-T and other control groups. In this revision, we used a permutation test to statistically assess the effect of block order and period (please see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for the definitions of block order and period; we have also revised the Statistics section to clearly explain the adopted method) on \u2206Force and the changes from the 1<sup>st</sup> to 2<sup>nd</sup>, from the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup>, and from the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> block. Using a permutation test did not substantially change the results."
